Description: A critical first step in systematic literature reviews
  and text mining is to identify relevant texts from a range of different
  sources, particularly academic databases such as 'Web of Science' or
  'Scopus'. These databases often export in different formats or with
  different metadata tags. 'Synthesisr' imports bibliographic data in a
  range of formats ('bibtex', 'ris', 'ciw') in a standard way, and allows
  merging and de-duplicating of the resulting dataset.
