Title: Import, Assemble, and Deduplicate Systematic Review Search Results
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eliza Grames
Maintainer: Eliza Grames <eliza.grames@uconn.edu>
Description: Systematic review searches include multiple databases
    that export results in a variety of formats with overlap in 
    coverage between databases. To streamline the process of importing,
    assembling, and deduplicating results, synthesisr recognizes the
    file output of commonly used databases for systematic reviews and
    merges results into a standardized format.
