Scriven, Sarah A.; Carlson, Kimberly M.; Hodgson, Jenny A.; McClean, Colin J.; Heilmayr, Robert; Lucey, Jennifer M.; Hill, Jane K.				Journal of Applied Ecology	56	10		2274-2285	Oct 2019	2019							Habitat connectivity is important for tropical biodiversity conservation. Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set-asides for forest connectivity. We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest-dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo. Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set-asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no-RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by [approximately]3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by [approximately]16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5-3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting). Future revisions to the RSPO's Principles and Criteria should also ensure that large (i.e. with a core area >2 km2) HCVAs are reconnected to continuous tracts of forest to maximize their connectivity benefits.

Valdes-Correcher, Elena; van Halder, Inge; Barbaro, Luc; Castagneyrol, Bastien; Hampe, Arndt				Forest Ecology and Management	445			146-153	Aug 1 2019	2019							The value of novel native broadleaf woodlands for biodiversity conservation is important to consider for adequate forest management in rural landscapes. Passive reforestation has been proposed as a cost-efficient tool for creating networks of novel native forest stands that would help restoring biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Yet to date the ecological functioning of such stands remains strongly understudied compared to forest remnants resulting from longer-term fragmentation. We assessed how the size and connectivity of newly established Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in rural landscapes of SW France affect rates of herbivory by different insect guilds as well as rates of avian insectivory and the abundance and richness of insectivorous birds. Comparing 18 novel forest stands along a gradient of size (0.04-1.15 ha) and cover of broadleaf forests in the surroundings (0-30% within a 500 m radius), we found that even the smallest stands are colonised by leaf miners and chewers/skeletonizers, and that rates of herbivory are globally comparable to those reported from older and larger oak forests. The size of stands had a relatively minor effect on herbivory, whereas it increased the abundance of insectivorous bird. It also determined rates of avian insectivory as estimated by an experiment with plasticine caterpillars. These rates were however rather low and unrelated with the extent of herbivory in the stand. Overall, our study indicates that insect herbivores tend to react more rapidly to the establishment of novel native forests than their avian predators as the latter may depend on the development of larger patches of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. To favour a rapid build-up of diverse, and hence stable, trophic networks involving insect herbivores and their predators, woodland creation schemes should therefore primarily focus on habitat size and quality.

While higher tree species diversity is commonly proposed to result in habitat of higher quality for forest species, how these tree diversity and tree composition effects interact with forest fragmentation in terms of critical resources and demographic effects on forest birds remains poorly understood. We investigated here possible synergistic effects of forest fragmentation and tree species composition on the breeding performance of two common, insectivorous forest birds in a human-dominated landscape in northern Belgium. We monitored the breeding performance of Great Tits and Blue Tits in 53 plots across independent gradients of tree species composition and forest fragmentation. In addition, data on the biomass of the main food source of these two species (i.e. caterpillars) was collected during the breeding season. Both tree composition and habitat fragmentation impacted the breeding performance of Great and Blue Tits. Effects of tree species composition were mainly driven by tree species identity, rather than by tree species diversity, and the highest breeding performance was obtained in monocultures of Pedunculate Oaks. Fragmentation effects were only observed in resource-poor Beech monocultures with breeding performance declining with reduction in forest area. Structural Equation Modelling revealed diverse and species-specific pathways: for Great Tits tree composition effects on breeding performance were driven by resource availability while for Blue Tits these effects were driven by variation in clutch size. Thus, forestry practices aiming at promoting forest-dependent birds could benefit from including tree species that support high arthropod numbers and by maintaining forest patches of larger sizes.

In mature forests, associational resistance of trees resulting from a high diversity of neighbouring trees is common, and can have cascading effects on tree growth through resource concentration effects or through changes in top-down control. While the underlying biological processes are known to be influenced by the forest's spatial properties, we lack insights on how resource concentration, top-down control and fragmentation jointly affect sapling performance in fragmented landscapes. We therefore experimentally quantified effects of the proportion of conspecific trees in the overstorey (resource concentration), avian top-down control (natural enemies) and distance to the forest edge on invertebrate herbivory levels and sapling growth. The assessments were made on planted saplings of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur and Quercus rubra in 53 experimental plots and birds were excluded by means of exclosures from a subset of these saplings. Excluding avian top-down control increased herbivory on each tree species. Increased herbivory led to decreased sapling growth in F. sylvatica and Q. rubra. On Q. robur saplings, top-down control was stronger closer to the forest edge. Furthermore, in this species, herbivory inside the exclosures increased with an increasing proportion of conspecific trees in the overstorey, while such a resource concentration effect was not observed outside the exclosures. Our results show the importance for forest management of conserving insectivorous birds and promoting a mixed overstorey, which can decrease sapling herbivory when bird abundance is low. More generally, our study provides insight into the complex, multitrophic interactions that drive sapling growth in forest stands located within fragmented landscapes.

Landscape Ecology	34	6		1395-1409	Jun 2019	2019							ContextIncreasing rates of habitat fragmentation globally underscore the importance of understanding the full spectrum of fragmentation's ecological consequences. Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.

Rutt, Cameron L.; Midway, Stephen R.; Jirinec, Vitek; Wolfe, Jared D.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Oikos	128	6		798-810	Jun 2019	2019							Proposed mechanisms for the decline of terrestrial and understory insectivorous birds in the tropics include a related subset that together has been termed the 'microclimate hypothesis'. One prediction from this hypothesis is that sensitivity to bright light environments discourages birds of the dimly lit rainforest interior from using edges, gaps, or disturbed forest. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and capture data across time and space, we tested this by first determining vulnerability based on differences in within-species capture rates between disturbed and undisturbed forest for 64 bird species at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonian Brazil. We found that 35 species (55%) were vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat degradation, whereas only four (6%) were more commonly captured in degraded forest. To infer visual sensitivity, we then examined two different characters: eye size (maximum pupil diameter) relative to body mass and the initiation time of dawn song, which presumably reflects a species' visual capacity under low light intensities. We predicted that species with large relative eye sizes and birds with earlier dawn songs would exhibit increased vulnerability in degraded habitats with bright light. Contrary to our predictions, however, vulnerability was positively correlated with the mean start time of dawn song. This indicates that species that wait to initiate dawn song are also more vulnerable to habitat degradation. After correcting for body size, there was no effect of eye size on vulnerability. Together, our results do not provide quantitative support for the light sensitivity mechanism of the microclimate hypothesis. More sensitive experimental tests, such as behavioral assays with controlled light environments, especially in a comparative framework, are needed to rigorously evaluate the role of light sensitivity as an aspect of the microclimate hypothesis among Neotropical birds.

Sekercioglu, Cagan H.; Mendenhall, Chase D.; Oviedo-Brenes, Federico; Horns, Joshua J.; Ehrlich, Paul R.; Daily, Gretchen C.				Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	116	20		9903-9912	May 14 2019	2019							Tropical agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss, yet it can provide conservation opportunities, especially where protected areas are inadequate. To investigate the long-term biodiversity capacity of agricultural countryside, we quantified bird population trends in Costa Rica by mist netting 57,255 birds of 265 species between 1999 and 2010 in sun coffee plantations, riparian corridors, secondary forests, forest fragments, and primary forest reserves. More bird populations (69) were declining than were stable (39) or increasing (4). Declines were common in resident, insectivorous, and more specialized species. There was no relationship between the species richness of a habitat and its conservation value. High-value forest bird communities were characterized by their distinct species composition and habitat and dietary functional signatures. While 49% of bird species preferred forest to coffee, 39% preferred coffee to forest and 12% used both habitats, indicating that coffee plantations have some conservation value. Coffee plantations, although lacking most of the forest specialists, hosted 185 bird species, had the highest capture rates, and supported increasing numbers of some forest species. Coffee plantations with higher tree cover (7% vs. 13%) had more species with increasing capture rates, twice as many forest specialists, and half as many nonforest species. Costa Rican countryside habitats, especially those with greater tree cover, host many bird species and are critical for connecting bird populations in forest remnants. Diversified agricultural landscapes can enhance the biodiversity capacity of tropical countryside, but, for the long-term persistence of all forest bird species, large (> 1,000 ha) protected areas are essential.

Furumo, Paul R.; Aide, T. Mitchell				Landscape Ecology	34	4		911-923	Apr 2019	2019							ContextExpanding oil palm plantations have caused widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia, stigmatizing the industry around the world regardless of regional context. In Latin America, oil palm plantations are primarily replacing other agroindustrial land uses with uncertain implications for local biodiversity.ObjectivesOur aim was to create empirical baseline data to help guide development of future plantations into areas where biodiversity impacts are minimized. We used soundscapes to assess fauna in oil palm landscapes of Colombia, the world's 4th largest palm oil producer.MethodsSoundscapes capture daily patterns of acoustic activity that can be used to measure differences between biotic communities between habitats. Using remnant forest fragments as reference sites, we sampled land use classes that are commonly replaced by commercial oil palm including cattle pastures, rice fields, and banana plantations.ResultsSoundscape analysis showed that even highly degraded forests have a unique soundscape compared to production systems. Similarities were found among closed canopy production sites (oil palm, banana) and open production habitat (pastures, rice), suggesting the importance of habitat structure for acoustic communities. Oil palm also showed notable overlap with pastures, but had soundscapes that were more similar to forest than the other production types.ConclusionsFuture oil palm development in Latin America can replace cattle pastures and other commodity plantation agriculture with minimal impacts on acoustic communities. New supply chain governance approaches such as the zero-deforestation agreements being implemented in the Colombian oil palm and cattle sectors may help guide the industry toward more sustainable development by continuing to target previously cleared lands.

Sandoval, Luis; Morales, Carlos O.; Ramirez-Fernandez, Jose D.; Hanson, Paul; Murillo-Hiller, Luis Ricardo; Barrantes, Gilbert				Revista de Biologia Tropical	67		S	36-52	Apr 2019	2019							Conservation efforts in terrestrial environments have focused on preserving patches of natural habitats and restoring disturbed habitats, with the main goal of transforming them into forests or habitats that resemble the original conditions. This approach tends to overlook the importance of conserving early successional vegetation (e.g., riverside vegetation, natural regeneration, young secondary forests), which often includes a large number of species (e.g., plants and animals) associated with or restricted to these habitats. In this paper we want to bring to attention the importance of preserving early successional vegetation, and to encourage scientists to investigate, e.g., the diversity, distribution, and species interactions occurring in these habitats. To address these goals, we focus on two main objectives: (1) to identify the common types of early successional vegetation in the Costa Rican Central Valley; and (2) to use some case studies to draw attention to the importance that such areas have as reservoirs of a large portion of the diversity unique to early successional stages. We first include an example to show the diversity of plants in small forest patches immersed in a large urbanized area. We provide general information on the insects that occur in early successional vegetation in urban areas, and in further detail examples of butterflies. Additionally, we provide examples of birds and mammals that are restricted to early successional vegetation, and how the reduction of this vegetation type affects species conservation. Finally, we encourage scientists to investigate these early successional habitats, particularly those species exclusive to early successional stages. Special attention should be paid to endemic species and those with a restricted distribution. Information of this type will make conservation of the diversity contained in these habitats possible.								0034-7744								ZOOREC:ZOOR15508051635					J	ZOOR15505029522		Patch-scale biodiversity retention in fragmented landscapes: Reconciling the habitat amount hypothesis with the island biogeography theory.		Bueno, Anderson Saldanha; Peres, Carlos A.				Journal of Biogeography	46	3		621-632	Mar 2019	2019							Aim To test whether the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands induced by a major hydroelectric dam is best explained by either the island biogeography theory (IBT) or the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH). Given the low dispersal ability of the focal species group and the hostile water matrix, we predict that the species richness will be predominantly driven by an island effect as posited by the IBT, rather than a sample area effect as posited by the HAH. Location Forest islands within the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, central Brazilian Amazonia. Taxon Birds. Methods We mist-netted birds at 33 forest islands (0.63-1,699 ha), totalling 874 individuals of 59 species. The size of the local landscape used to calculate the habitat amount was determined by a multi-scale analysis in which buffers around mist-net lines ranged from 50 to 2,000 m. We applied four tests to examine whether the species richness on forest islands is predominantly driven by either an island effect (island size) or a sample area effect (habitat amount). Results From the four tests applied, one was consistent with an island effect, two were regarded as inappropriate to test the HAH, and one could not be adequately addressed due to island size being highly correlated with habitat amount in the local landscape (200-m buffer). Main conclusions Some of the proposed ways of testing the HAH may lead to misleading conclusions. The relative importance of island size in determining the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands is higher than that of surrounding habitat amount, thereby providing stronger support for IBT. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the degree of matrix permeability and species dispersal ability, to determine to what extent a patch- or landscape-centric worldview in landscape ecology provides the most appropriate framework to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

In this study, we identified and characterized mosquito blood meals from both urban and forested areas in the city of Paranagua, state of Parana, Brazil, by analyzing the amplification of host DNA ingested by mosquitoes under different storage conditions and digestion levels. Host DNA preservation was evaluated in fresh blood meals according to storage duration (30 to 180 days) and temperature (-20[degree]C / -80[degree]C) and, in digested blood, according the degree of digestion classified on the Sella scale. Molecular analysis of blood meals was based on DNA extraction and amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene. We determined that, up to 180 days of storage, the evaluated temperatures did not influence the preservation of fresh blood meals DNA, whereas the amplification success was increasingly reduced over the course of the digestion process. The species Anopheles cruzii, Aedes fluviatilis, Aedes scapularis, Psorophora ferox, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex mollis, and Culex intrincatus, together with specimens representing four subgenera and one genus of Culicidae (Ae. (Ochlerotatus), Cx. (Culex), Cx. (Melanoconion), Cx. (Microculex), and Limatus, respectively) had their blood meals identified. Their diverse host use was evidenced by the identification of 19 species of vertebrate host, namely two amphibians, three mammals and 14 birds. Birds were the most commonly identified host in blood meals. These results not only show the diversity of mosquito hosts, but also underscore the challenges involved in monitoring arboviruses of public health importance, given potential combinations of host use for each mosquito species.			da Silva, Mario Antonio Navarro/C-5287-2013; Santos, Camila Silva/R-2137-2019; S.

Occasional Papers of the IUCN Species Survival Commission	62			309-316	2019	2019							New Caledonia is a tropical archipelago of the South Pacific Ocean, and is one of the 36 world biodiversity hotspots. However, its unique biodiversity is increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and introductions of invasive alien species. Among these invaders, the red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently expanding towards the north of the main island. This passerine features in the IUCN-ISSG list of the 100 worst invasive species of the world because of impacts caused by its diet. Thirty-five years after its introduction, we present an overview of data from recent studies conducted in New Caledonia that describe the local status of the red-vented bulbul, its range expansion, and potential impacts on both the local biodiversity and agriculture. Biannual monitoring of the distribution coupled with surveillance at the edges of native forests highlighted a tight association of the bulbul with man-modified habitats. Using a distance sampling method, we estimated that bulbul densities within the distribution core varied from a peak of 200 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup> in the main city of Noumea, where the species has been introduced, to 30 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in rural habitats located 50 km away from Noumea. We conducted a diet analysis on 40 bulbul corpses and found that 82% and 55% of individuals had consumed plant and animal items, respectively. We identified plant and insect species that may be of concern in the contexts of seed dispersal and predation by the red-vented bulbul. Finally, a food colour selection experiment and an open field test showed that the red-vented bulbul had a significant preference for red and sweet fruits. We estimated the economic loss caused by bulbuls to a tomato grower and discuss the result with respect to the development of an adapted management strategy, to prevent further impacts of the red-vented bulbul on the biodiversity and agriculture in the tropical island hotspot of New Caledonia.								1026-4965								ZOOREC:ZOOR15601002542					J	ZOOR15511075676		Snacks in the city: the diet of hedgehogs in Auckland urban forest fragments.

While the impacts of some mammalian pest species, such as rats (Rattus spp.), are relatively well-known in New Zealand, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are relatively understudied invasive mammals, and their impacts in urban fragments are unknown. Hedgehogs are abundant and widespread in New Zealand, with a relatively broad diet that can include invertebrates, lizards and bird eggs. We examined the stomach contents of 44 hedgehogs collected from 10 forest fragments in urban Auckland, New Zealand. Hedgehogs were feeding predominantly on invertebrates (Coleoptera, found in 53% of stomachs; earthworms, 43%; slugs, 23%), but also weta (13%), giant centipedes (5%), birds (7%) and lizards (2%) at lower frequencies. Hedgehogs are likely to be affecting community composition primarily through predation of invertebrates, with unknown effects on their populations.

Nottingham, Catherine M.; Glen, Alistair S.; Stanley, Margaret C.				Global Ecology and Conservation	17			e00534	Jan 2019	2019							Damage function models can determine the nature of relationships between the pest population and impact, and can provide guidance about when pest control is required. However, damage functions usually assess risk to species currently occupying conservation areas. Damage functions are not currently used to predict risk to species yet to be reintroduced to conservation areas. While the impacts of several mammalian pest species, such as rats (Rattus spp.), are relatively well-known in urban forest fragments, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are relatively understudied invasive mammals, and their impacts in urban fragments are unknown. Conservation areas within cities provide important habitat for native species and are a focus of current conservation efforts. We developed a damage function describing the relationship between the relative abundance of hedgehogs (determined using a chew card index) and their potential impact (estimated by egg mortality in artificial nests) in a New Zealand urban environment. Egg mortality was positively related to hedgehog abundance, although some egg mortality occurred even at the lowest hedgehog abundances measured. Conservation managers should prioritise hedgehog control at sites of highest hedgehog relative abundances and/or sites containing high value species likely to be at risk. Our results demonstrate the need for conservation managers to proactively assess potential threats to protected areas. Further, we show that damage functions provide an objective means of assessing threats prior to reintroduction of species. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Wright, Penny E.; Lambert, Kathryn T.A.; McDonald, Paul G.				Australian Mammalogy	41	1		49-56	2019	2019							Bell miner-associated dieback (BMAD) is a form of canopy decline involving bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) colonies on the eastern coast of Australia. The association can include an understorey of lantana (Lantana camara) preventing eucalypt regeneration. To date, comparatively little is known about the effects of these processes on mammal diversity and abundance. We therefore considered the effects of BMAD and lantana presence on ground mammals and insectivorous bats in four forest sites within New South Wales. These were monitored in association with a restoration project for the treatment of lantana that used glyphosate spraying to kill lantana in half of six 50mx50m quadrats per site (three control and three treated). Passive bioacoustic recorders, infrared cameras and Elliott traps were used to survey understorey fauna over four consecutive nights during each season. We found a greater number of small ground-dwelling and large mammals in control areas with an intact understorey of lantana relative to areas where lantana had been treated. However, insectivorous bats were not influenced by lantana presence. Our results suggest that ground-dwelling mammals benefit from the presence of lantana, as it may provide structural complexity that reduces predation risk and/or provides a food resource.

Mansor, Mohammad Saiful; Nor, Shukor Md.; Ramli, Rosli; Sah, Shahrul Anuar Mohd				Behavioural Processes	157			73-79	Dec 2018	2018							With the rapid growth of agricultural areas globally, forest birds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes in which forest patches are surrounded by an agricultural plantation matrix, yet how birds respond behaviourally to this fragmentation is poorly understood. Information on microhabitat requirements of birds is scarce, but nevertheless essential to predicting adaptation of bird species to the patchy landscapes. We investigated foraging patterns of three tropical insectivorous birds, Green bra Aegithina viridissima, Pin-striped Tit-Babbler Macronus gularis and Chestnut-winged Babbler Cyanoderma erythropterum, to determine whether they vary in foraging methods in different forest patches. Our study area encompassed old-logged lowland forest; one continuous forest and three forest patches. Observations were performed for 15 days every month for a period of 13 months. Information on foraging height, substrate, attack manoeuvres, and foliage density was collected independently for each foraging bird individual. All three species used different foraging substrates and attack manoeuvres in different habitat types. The Green bra frequently used lower strata when foraging in forest patches as opposed to continuous forest, while the Pin-striped Tit-Babbler tended to forage in more dense vegetation in patches. Only Chestnut-winged Babbler displayed complete foraging plasticity across all study parameters. Different habitat features (e.g., edges, microclimates) between continuous forest and forest patches significantly influenced the foraging strategies of the study species. These changes in foraging strategies suggest that some Malaysian forest birds (e.g. generalist species) can respond behaviourally to fragmentation and habitat loss. Although continuous forest has critically important characteristics that need to be conserved, remnant forest patches are also important as ecological movement corridors and foraging grounds for birds.

Methods: Three ecologically isolated forested areas near urban environments were surveyed during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016, using a multi-trapping approach comprising ground-level and canopy light traps, black and white colored cloth Shannon traps and manual aspiration on tree bases. Female phlebotomines were dissected to find infections and isolate flagellates from Leishmania spp. The strains were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and compared with those of local ACL cases and World Health Organization reference strains. Results: Nyssomyia umbratilis, Trichopygomyia trichopyga and Evandromyia infraspinosa were the most frequently found species. Findings on relative abundance, spatiotemporal vector/ACL congruence, natural infections and anthropophilic insights strengthened the Guianan classical transmission of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis by Ny. umbratilis and suggested further investigations for Ev. infraspinosa. Nyssomyia umbratilis showed an eclectic feeding habit, including bird blood.

McClure, Katherine M.; Lawrence, Charlotte; Kilpatrick, A. Marm				Journal of Medical Entomology	55	6		1509-1516	Nov 2018	2018							Vector abundance plays a key role in transmission of mosquito-borne disease. In Hawaii, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), the Asian tiger mosquito, has been implicated in locally-transmitted dengue outbreaks, while Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), the southern house mosquito, is the primary vector of avian malaria, a wildlife disease that has contributed to declines and extinctions of native Hawaiian birds. Despite the importance of these introduced species to human and wildlife health, little is known about the local-scale drivers that shape mosquito abundance across lowland Hawaii, where forest, agricultural, and residential land uses are prevalent. We examined landscape, larval habitat, and climate drivers of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus abundance in eight lowland wet forest fragments on the Big Island of Hawaii. We found that the abundance of both species increased with the proportion of surrounding developed land and the availability of larval habitat, which were themselves correlated. Our findings suggest that conversion of natural habitats to residential and agricultural land increases mosquito larval habitats, increasing the abundance of Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus and increasing disease risk to humans and wildlife in Hawaii. Our results further indicate that while source reduction of artificial larval habitats-particularly moderately-sized human-made habitats including abandoned cars and tires-could reduce mosquito abundance, eliminating larval habitat will be challenging because both species utilize both natural and human-made larval habitats in lowland Hawaii.								0022-2585								ZOOREC:ZOOR15504022053	30085189				J	ZOOR15502007144		Foraging ecology and flocking behavior of insectivorous forest birds inform management of Andean silvopastures for conservation.		Tarbox, Bryan C.; Robinson, Scott K.; Loiselle, Bette; Flory, S. Luke				Condor	120	4		787-802	Nov 2018	2018							Wildlife-friendly agricultural practices, such as agroforestry, can play an important role in conserving biodiversity by providing and connecting habitat across working landscapes. Silvopastures (i.e. pastures with substantial tree cover), in particular, possess considerable potential for conserving biodiversity due to the dominance of pastoral landscapes in many regions. However, to balance tradeoffs between the conservation and agricultural values of these anthropogenic systems, better information on wildlife use and how it relates to habitat quality is needed. To improve our mechanistic understanding of silvopastoral habitat quality, and to develop management recommendations, we evaluated the foraging behavior of insectivorous forest birds in Andean silvopastures compared with forest fragments. Focal species' prey attack rates were >25% lower in silvopastures than in forest fragments, suggesting that arthropod prey were less abundant or accessible in silvopastures than in forest fragments. In forest fragments, birds in mixed-species foraging flocks attacked prey more frequently than solitary birds. In silvopastures, flocking and solitary birds attacked prey at similar rates, and birds foraged in flocks half as frequently as in forest fragments. Insectivorous birds preferentially foraged in a small subset of tree genera in forest fragments, but did not exhibit selective foraging in less botanically diverse silvopastures. Insectivorous species that used silvopastures foraged in microhabitats such as vine tangles and hanging dead leaves less frequently than species that did not use silvopastures. Forest species that used silvopastures may have been negatively affected by a breakdown of beneficial interspecific interactions in silvopastures, highlighting the potential for cascading effects of species loss in anthropogenic habitats. Managing silvopastures to include preferred tree species and microhabitats could improve their habitat quality for forest species, but strategies to enhance the conservation value of managed landscapes with silvopastures must also include preservation of forest fragments.								0010-5422								ZOOREC:ZOOR15502007144					J	ZOOR15502007041		Habitat fragmentation, not habitat loss, drives the prevalence of blood parasites in a Caribbean passerine.		Perez-Rodriguez, Anton; Khimoun, Aurelie; Ollivier, Anthony; Eraud, Cyril; Faivre, Bruno; Garnier, Stephane				Ecography	41	11		1835-1849	Nov 2018	2018							Habitat destruction due to human land-use activities is well recognized as a central threat to biodiversity. However, there is still debate about the relative influence of its two components, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, mostly because few studies have been able to disentangle their respective effects. We studied mechanisms by which habitat destruction might influence the prevalence of vector-transmitted haemosporidian blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infecting the Lesser Antillean bullfinch Loxigilla noctis on the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Starting from a large set of environmental descriptors (including metrics reflecting habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and landscape heterogeneity; as well as other variables not linked to habitat destruction, such as climatic conditions), we used PLS regression analyses to determine which variables were driving parasite prevalence on the islands. Our results showed that variables related to forest destruction were much more influential than other factors for all parasites analyzed on both islands. Remarkably, the effects documented were almost exclusively due to forest fragmentation, as opposed to habitat loss. This positive effect of forest fragmentation on blood parasite prevalence is proposed to happen through its effects on insect vectors and/or host biology. Increased understanding of the role of habitat fragmentation as a driver of parasitic diseases can help limiting the risk of emergence and proliferation of wildlife pathogenic outbreaks and zoonosis through informed landscape planning.

Maure, Lucas A.; Rodrigues, Rodolpho C.; Alcantara, Angelo V.; Adorno, Bruno F.C.B.; Santos, Douglas L.; Abreu, Eduardo L.; Tanaka, Rafael M.; Goncalves, Rute M.; Hasui, Erica				Ecology and Evolution	8	21		10395-10408	Nov 2018	2018							Riparian ecosystems are suffering anthropogenic threats that reduce biodiversity and undermine ecosystem services. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the way species composition of assemblages is related to ecosystem function, especially in a landscape fragmentation context. Here, we assess the impact of habitat loss and disturbance on Functional Diversity (FD) components Functional Redundancy (FRed), Functional Evenness (FEve), and Functional Richness (FRic) of riparian forest bird assemblages to evaluate (a) how FD components respond to riparian forest width reduction and vegetation disturbance; (b) the existence of thresholds within these relationships; (c) which of the main birds diet guild (frugivores, insectivores, and omnivores) respond to such thresholds. We predict that FD components will be affected negatively and nonlinearly by riparian changes. However, guilds could have different responses due to differences of species sensitivity to fragmentation and disturbance. We expect to find thresholds in FD responses, because fragmentation and disturbance drive loss of specific FD components. Our results show that FRed and FEve were linearly affected by width and disturbance of riparian habitats, respectively. FRed was significantly lower in riparian forests assemblages below 400 m wide, and FEve was significantly higher above 60% disturbance. These responses of FD were also followed to the decline in insectivores and frugivores richness in riparian forests most affected by these changes. Consequently, our study suggests communities do not tolerate reduction in riparian forest width or disturbance intensification without negative impact on FD, and this becomes more critical for riparian area FRed is greater than the minimum width required for riparian forests by Brazilian law. Thus, it is important to consider mechanisms to expand riparian habitats and reduce the disturbance intensity in riparian forests so that riparian bird community FD may be effectively conserved.

Theory predicts a decrease in parasite diversity due to the loss of hosts in such contexts. However, habitat loss could also increase parasite infections as a result of the arrival of new parasites or by decreasing host immune defenses. We investigated the effect of habitat loss and other habitat characteristics on avian haemosporidian infections in a community of birds within a fragmented landscape in northwest Ecuador. We estimated Plasmodium and Haemoproteus parasite infections in 504 individual birds belonging to 8 families and 18 species. We found differences in infection status among bird species, but no relationship between forest fragment characteristics and infection status was observed. We also found a temporal effect, with birds at the end of the five-month study (which ran from the end of the rainy season thru the dry season), being less infected by Plasmodium parasites than individuals sampled at the beginning. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between forest area and Culicoides abundance. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate little effect of fragment characteristics per se on infection, although additional sampling or higher infection rates would have offered more power to detect potential relationships.								1932-6203								ZOOREC:ZOOR15502006351	30379912				J	ZOOR15502007846		Using functional connectivity to predict potential meta-population sizes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.		Hatfield, Jack H.; Orme, C. David L.; Banks-Leite, Cristina				Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation	16	4		215-220	Oct 2018	2018							Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce population sizes and increase isolation between populations. To better understand how functional connectivity is affected by habitat modification over large scales, we here applied a meta-population framework to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly degraded and fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Other studies have used mainly hypothetical or estimated dispersal values for connectivity calculation which may not be reflective of species requirements. Here, we collated dispersal values for 45 species of birds, 5 mammals and 4 insects and found that 50% of the Atlantic Forest species can cross only up to 150 m of open gaps between forest patches. Because of the high levels of fragmentation, the median size of a functionally connected network of fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest only decreased from 15 ha to 14 ha when the crossable distance considered was reduced from 150 m to 0 m. We show that for species solely reliant on native forest habitat, a large proportion of the remaining Atlantic Forest fragments represent many small and isolated populations with few large connected areas. Our results support further evidence that for future management and restoration to be successful, existing connectivity must be vastly improved to provide forest areas large enough to support viable populations.

We tested whether changes in the density of neighborhood conspecific and heterospecific plants and in the availability of resources influence the frequency and composition of floral and frugivorous visitors of eleven individuals of the same population of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis in Brazil. The frequency of floral visitors was positively associated with conspecific density and availability of resources. Species composition was affected by the availability of resources since some bee species were associated with palms that offered more flowers, whereas others were associated with palms that offered less. Two bee species may be able to mediate long-distance pollen-flow for E. edulis: an undetermined species of Euglossini and Apis mellifera. Frugivorous birds were not influenced by any of the factors investigated. Birds of the genus Turdus predominated in the assemblage and were responsible for most of the interactions. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike larger birds, species of Turdus are considered resilient to environmental disturbances. Due to the continuous defaunation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the number of large birds that can promote long-distance seed dispersal is declining, with implications for the genetic diversity of E. edulis. Measures to restore the population density of E. edulis will likely favor the recovery of its genetic diversity due to its high capacity for distant pollen dispersal. Recovering and protecting large frugivorous birds may also contribute to the maintenance of the population density and genetic diversity of E. edulis.

Direct negative effects of invasive omnivores are well documented, but the indirect effects of resource competition or those caused by predator avoidance are unknown. Here we isolated and examined the independent and interactive effects of invasive omnivorous Black rats (Rattus rattus) and forest fragment size on the interactions between avian predators and their arthropod prey. Our study examines whether invasive omnivores and ecosystem fragment size impact: 1) the vertical distribution of arthropod species composition and abundance, and 2) the vertical profile of foraging behaviors of five native and two non-native bird species found in our study system. We predicted that the reduced edge effects and greater structural complexity and canopy height of larger fragments would limit the total and proportional habitat space frequented by rats and thus limit their impact on both arthropod biomass and birds' foraging behavior. We experimentally removed invasive omnivorous Black rats across a 100-fold (0.1 to 12 ha) size gradient of forest fragments on Hawaii Island, and paired foraging observations of forest passerines with arthropod sampling in the 16 rat-removed and 18 control fragments. Rat removal was associated with shifts in the vertical distribution of arthropod biomass, irrespective of fragment size. Bird foraging behavior mirrored this shift, and the impact of rat removal was greater for birds that primarily eat fruit and insects compared with those that consume nectar. Evidence from this model study system indicates that invasive rats indirectly alter the feeding behavior of native birds, and consequently impact multiple trophic levels. This study suggests that native species can modify their foraging behavior in response to invasive species removal and presumably arrival through behavioral plasticity.

Toucans have been known to forage widely for fruit in fragmented landscapes. Our cameras indicated that they additionally foraged on and near the ground for insects or other animal prey in relatively predator-free forest patches. As key agents of dispersal of large-seeded old-growth trees, toucans and other large frugivores were likely responsible for recruitment of animal-dispersed tree species of mature forest in our experimental plantings, even in stands of wind-dispersed trees or controls where animal-dispersed tree species were not planted.								1559-4491								ZOOREC:ZOOR15505028937					J	ZOOR15410071228		Food preferences determine habitat selection at multiple scales: implication for bird conservation in tropical forests.		Chatterjee, S.; Basu, P.				Animal Conservation	21	4		332-342	Aug 2018	2018							Forest degradation and fragmentation of quality habitat across the tropics underpins an urgent need for the conservation of area-sensitive species. Management strategies adopted for small-scale landscape patches may not be suitable for conservation of different communities across large landscapes. In this context, we examined the relationship of bird community composition and different bird functional groups with tree cover and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at multiple landscape scales and also tested the effect of forest degradation on bird community composition. This study demonstrates the importance of core forest habitat for the conservation of area sensitive species. Forest degradation had negative impact on the bird community composition though some functional groups were associated with degraded areas. At the community level, bird density and richness was best explained by a combination of both NDVI at the patch level (50 m scale) and tree cover at the landscape level (500 m scale) where the patch level character was found to be more important than landscape level character. Most of the functional groups which preferred insects as primary or secondary diet items were sensitive to differences at the patch level (NDVI), whereas large frugivorous species were sensitive to differences at the landscape level (tree cover). High vegetation complexity should be conserved at the patch level (at least up to 50 m) for the conservation of insectivorous, nectarivorous and small to medium size frugivorous groups and tree cover should be conserved at the landscape level (at least up to 500 m) for the conservation of large-bodied frugivorous birds.

Biological Conservation	224			336-346	Aug 2018	2018							Cross-taxonomic surrogates are often used in conservation planning because inventorying large suites of taxa is either not feasible or too costly. However, cross-taxonomic surrogates are seldom tested rigorously using both correlational and representation-based approaches at the spatial scales at which conservation management occurs. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of five ecologically contrasting taxa (birds, herpetofauna, wild bees, beetles, trees) as cross-taxonomic surrogates in native woodland patches within a heavily modified, farming and plantation-dominated landscape. We first compared species richness and compositional heterogeneity across taxa before testing for cross-taxonomic congruence using a correlative approach. We then quantified how well each taxon incidentally represented other taxa in their best patch sets, and the costs of doing so using a complementarity-based approach. We found significant pairwise associations between some taxa (birds, bees), but no single taxon was strongly correlated with all other taxa. Woodland patch sets prioritised for beetles represented other taxa best, followed by birds, but were the costliest and required the largest amount of woodland. This contrasted with patch sets prioritised for wild bees or herpetofauna, which achieved higher representation of other taxa at lower costs. Our study highlighted the influence of taxon-specific patterns of diversity and heterogeneity on how remnant vegetation patches should be prioritised for conservation, a consideration not immediately obvious in correlative analyses of surrogacy. Second, taxa that are not the most speciose (e.g. wild bees) can be efficient surrogates, achieving higher incidental representation for other taxa at lower costs. Thus, while species-rich taxa are ideal as surrogates for prioritising conservation, conservation planners should not overlook the potential of less speciose taxa such as bees, while considering the cost-effectiveness of surveying multiple different taxa.

Seven separate surveys between 1990 and 2014 indicated declines in at least six of eight species detected, with large-bodied species hardest hit. Depleted remnant populations of large hornbills mainly persist in two large and relatively well-protected wildlife reserves, Ankasa Resource Reserve and Kakum National Park. Contrastingly, the five largest species of the nine hornbills known to Bia Biosphere Reserve, one of Ghana's few forest wildlife reserves, apparently vanished completely since the 1990s, mainly due to uncontrolled hunting. Similarly, several large hornbills have disappeared from forest reserves where hunting is widespread. We conclude that uncontrolled hunting is the major driver of the recent drastic declines and population extirpations of large hornbills, while reductions in small insectivorous species may be related to extensive fragmentation and habitat disturbances of the Ghanaian forest biome. We call for urgent conservation action to prevent further declines and impending extirpations of forest hornbills and other wildlife in West Africa.

Appelgren, Anais S.C.; Saladin, Verena; Richner, Heinz; Doligez, Blandine; McCoy, Karen D.				BMC Evolutionary Biology	18			99	Jun 19 2018	2018							Background: In host-parasite systems, relative dispersal rates condition genetic novelty within populations and thus their adaptive potential. Knowledge of host and parasite dispersal rates can therefore help us to understand current interaction patterns in wild populations and why these patterns shift over time and space. For generalist parasites however, estimates of dispersal rates depend on both host range and the considered spatial scale. Here, we assess the relative contribution of these factors by studying the population genetic structure of a common avian ectoparasite, the hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae, exploiting two hosts that are sympatric in our study population, the great tit Paws major and the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. Previous experimental studies have indicated that the hen flea is both locally maladapted to great tit populations and composed of subpopulations specialized on the two host species, suggesting limited parasite dispersal in space and among hosts, and a potential interaction between these two structuring factors. Results: C gallinae fleas were sampled from old nests of the two passerine species in three replicate wood patches and were genotyped at microsatellite markers to assess population genetic structure at different scales (among individuals within a nest among nests and between host species within a patch and among patches). As expected, significant structure was found at all spatial scales and between host species, supporting the hypothesis of limited dispersal in this parasite. Clustering analyses and estimates of relatedness further suggested that inbreeding regularly occurs within nests. Patterns of isolation by distance within wood patches indicated that flea dispersal likely occurs in a stepwise manner among neighboring nests. From these data, we estimated that gene flow in the hen flea is approximately half that previously described for its great tit hosts. Conclusion: Our results fall in line with predictions based on observed patterns of adaptation in this host-parasite system, suggesting that parasite dispersal is limited and impacts its adaptive potential with respect to its hosts. More generally, this study sheds light on the complex interaction between parasite gene flow, local adaptation and host specialization within a single host-parasite system.

Oliveira, Helon Simoes; Pedroso, Monica Aparecido; Santos, Jose Weverton; Pereira, Arivania Santos; Ruiz-Esparza, Juan; da Rocha, Patricio Adriano; Beltrao-Mendes, Raone; Ferrari, Stephen Francis				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	26	2		105-115	Jun 2018	2018							The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been transformed into a mosaic of forest fragments that impacts local populations of vertebrates, in particular birds. In the state of Sergipe, Brazil, while only approximately 10% of the original forest remains, ornithological research is still incipient, and basic data are still lacking. In this context, the present study investigated the bird community of a remnant of Atlantic Forest in the municipality of Japoata using complementary methods in a rapid survey approach. The composition of the community and its trophic guilds was defined and compared with other localities in Sergipe, and Atlantic Forest sites in other Brazilian states. Data were collected in October 2016, by mist-netting and the compilation of MacKinnon lists. A total of 118 bird species were recorded during 1088 net-h and in 60 MacKinnon lists. Four of these species are under some risk of extinction, and one of these is endemic to the region. The most diverse families were Thraupidae, Tyrannidae, Trochilidae, and Thamnophilidae, with the relative contribution of each family varying according to the the sampling method used. The most common species were Manacus manacus (Linnaeus, 1766) and Coereba flaveola (Linnaeus, 1758). The omnivores were the largest guild (n = 301 individuals), followed by the insectivores (n = 236) and the frugivores n = 146). The combined survey approach proved effective, increasing the number of bird species known to occur in the study area to 165, with an increase of more than 40% in comparison with previous surveys in the same area. Overall, the results of the present study reinforce the need for further ornithological surveys in the region, and the value of combining complementary approaches for a more comprehensive inventory during rapid surveys.

Alvarez-Alvarez, Edson A.; Corcuera, Pablo; Carlos Almazan-Nunez, R.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	130	2		457-469	Jun 2018	2018							Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the Neotropics as a result of agriculture, cattle ranching, and timber extraction. The effects of disturbance on the bird communities of this ecosystem have not been well studied. In this study, we evaluated changes in the richness, abundance, and diversity of birds and their diet types in the following land uses in southwestern Mexico: agroecosystem, palm grove, forest edge, and undisturbed forest. Visual and auditory sampling was performed for 1 year (August 2014 to July 2015) in 40 circular plots with a radius of 30 m (10 plots per land use). Differences in the composition and the abundance of bird species in plots of distinct land use were analyzed by a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to determine similarity among the data. In total, 101 species from 29 families were found in the study sites. The agroecosystem presented the greatest species richness (70 species), followed by undisturbed forest (57). Overall abundance of birds differed significantly among land uses. Bird abundance and dominance, in addition to the abundance of diet types, also varied significantly among land uses and between dry and rainy seasons. We found species of open habitats as well as species dependent on undisturbed forest fragments. The results suggest that seasonal variation in the abundance of birds is mainly determined by the availability of food resources and other local environmental factors. The abundance of carnivorous, granivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous, and frugivorous birds was higher at disturbed sites while the abundance of nectarivorous birds was higher in the undisturbed forest. The species composition of the undisturbed forest was most distinct among the land uses. Our results showed that the comparison of diet types was more useful for understanding the effect of land-use changes than the sole evaluation of the structural patterns of bird assemblages.								1559-4491							10.1676/17-009.1	ZOOREC:ZOOR15409060905					J	ZOOR15409058048		Primary rainforest amount at the landscape scale mitigates bird biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization.		Kormann, Urs G.; Hadley, Adam S.; Tscharntke, Teja; Betts, Matthew G.; Robinson, W. Douglas; Scherber, Christoph				Journal of Applied Ecology	55	3		1288-1298	May 2018	2018							1. Tropical conservation strategies traditionally focus on large tracts of pristine forests but, given rapid primary forest decline, understanding the role of secondary forest remnants for biodiversity maintenance is critical. Until now, the interactive effects of changes in forest amount, configuration and disturbance history (secondary vs. primary forest) on the conservation value of tropical landscapes have remained unknown, hampering the incorporation of these global change drivers into local and global conservation planning. 2. We disentangled effects of landscape-wide forest amount, fragment size and forest age (old growth vs. secondary forest) on abundance, [beta]-diversity, [beta]-diversity (biotic homogenization) and community shifts of bird communities in human-dominated landscapes of southern Costa Rica. Utilizing two complementary methods, yielding 6,900 individual detections and 223 species, we characterized bird communities in 49 forest fragments representing independent gradients in fragment size (<5 ha vs. >30 ha) and forest amount (5%-80%) in the surrounding landscape (within 1000 m). 3. Abundance and [beta]-diversity of forest specialists and insectivores declined by half in small fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest. Conversely, secondary forest at the landscape scale showed no such compensation effect. Similarly, a null-model approach indicated significant biotic homogenization in small vs. large fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest, suggesting forest amount and configuration interactively affect [beta]-diversity in tropical human-dominated landscapes. Finally, dramatic abundance-based community shifts relative to intact forests are largely a result of landscape-scale loss of old growth rather than changes in overall forest cover. 4.Policy implications. Our study provides strong evidence that retaining old growth within tropical human-modified landscapes can simultaneously curb erosion of avian forest specialist [beta]-diversity, mitigate collapse of [beta]-diversity (biotic homogenization) and dampen detrimental avian community shifts. However, secondary forests play, at best, a subordinate role to mitigate these processes. To maintain tropical forest biodiversity, retaining old-growth forest within landscapes should be first priority, highlighting a land-sparing approach.

Jirinec, Vitek; Elizondo, Elisa C.; Rutt, Cameron L.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Ornitologia Neotropical	29			13-20	Feb 2 2018	2018							The Variegated Antpitta (Grallaria varia) is the largest member of the terrestrial insectivores guild within its Amazonian range. Despite the bird's large size and loud vocalizations, however, basic aspects of G. varia's natural history remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted intensive tracking of one individual in a nature reserve in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, describing - for the first time with radio telemetry - space use, movement patterns, and roosting sites of G. varia. Over the course of 50 days in July and August 2017, the tracked individual moved slowly through a home range covering [approximately] 17.6 ha and was generally quiet, singing at only two of 68 locations that together comprised its home range. Of five roosting sites, four included visual observations where the bird slept 3-7 (mean 4.5) m aboveground in relatively open mid-story trees. We found no evidence of commutes to regular roost sites as all nocturnal locations were located close (mean 59.6 m, range 24-101 m) to the most recent diurnal locations. Slow movements on the ground without commutes to foraging or roosting sites help explain low capture rates in mist nets for this species. Our telemetry data suggest that G. varia home range may be larger than previously estimated in studies that relied heavily on bird vocalizations to determine area needs, though such methods may yield adequate results at times when birds vocalize frequently. Regardless, large area requirements help to explain the disappearance of G. varia documented in tropical forest fragments.								1075-4377								ZOOREC:ZOOR15405030484					J	ZOOR15411078213		Analysis of body condition of Passerine birds in dry zones of the north of Upper Magdalena Valley, Colombia.

Nathalia Sanchez-Guzman, Jessica; Losada-Prado, Sergio; Moreno-Palacios, Miguel				Caldasia	40	1		1-17	Jan 2018	2018							Body condition (BC) is a measure of the nutritional status of an animal represented mainly by the size of its energy reserves. In birds this condition is related with the biological fitness of the individual as it has effects on its behavior, reproductive success and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the BC of passerine birds in a Tropical dry forest fragment located north of the department of Tolima, Colombia, and analyze its seasonal and interannual changes over the years 2010-2014. The BC of 37 species was evaluated using the scaled mass index, which includes morphometric data such as wing chord length, tarsus length, total length, and body mass. The species that showed statistical differences in BC belonged to trophic groups Insectivore, Insectivore-Frugivore and Granivore-Insectivore. Interarmual differences (P < 0.05) were found in the BC of Cyclarhis gujanensis, Sporophila funerea, Sporophila schistacea and Volatinia jacarina, and interseasonal differences in the BC of Camptostoma obsoletum, Euscarthmus meloryphus and Stelgidopteryx ruficollis. The only species that showed significant variations in both temporal scales were Sporophila minuta and Certhiaxis cinnamomeus. We concluded that BC varies significantly in some bird species on a seasonal or interannual scale and not globally in the Passeriformes assemblage. This variation is mediated mainly by the effects of precipitation on other ecosystem variables such as food availability, which is considered responsible for the energetic contribution and the weight gain of the individuals.

Smith, C.; Milligan, M.C.; Johnson, M.D.; Njoroge, P.				Global Ecology and Conservation	13			e00378	Jan 2018	2018							Land conversion represents a serious threat to terrestrial biodiversity and effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes requires an understanding of the relationship between spatial heterogeneity and biodiversity. Coffee is the most valuable tropical export in the world with the capacity to affect biodiversity on a large scale, and much of the world's coffee is grown in open plantations (sun coffee), where little research has documented how landscape structure or food availability affect bird diversity. We examined the effects of both landscape characteristics and foliage arthropod abundance on bird species richness, total bird abundance and the abundance of foraging guilds in sun coffee plantations of central Kenyan highlands. Variation in the local landscape appeared to have little effect on bird abundance, while the foliage arthropod community, particularly number of arthropod orders, may have a strong impact on omnivore and insectivore abundance in sun coffee. These results do not mean small scale fragments or landscape composition is unimportant to bird communities in our region for several reasons, including the high model uncertainty that may indicate an important missing variable, the habitat complexity and presence of large forest reserves around our study sites, and the single scale at which our variables were tested. Our results indicate that farm managers wanting to increase bird abundance, especially omnivores and insectivores, should consider balancing the need to eradicate coffee pests and leaving an intact arthropod community that likely increases these guilds. Further study is needed to validate these patterns, which may have strong implications for bird biodiversity in agricultural settings across other areas in eastern Africa.

The Mata do Cedro forest, located in Alagoas state, northeastern Brazil, is a forest fragment within the PCE surrounded by a matrix of sugarcane that acts as a refuge for several threatened bird species, some of which are endemic to the region. Here, we characterize the bird community in Mata do Cedro using measures of species abundance, frequency of occurrence, habitat use and sensitivity to human disturbance. The functional role of species was investigated with a functional dendrogram. We registered 111 species, most resident and forest dependent. The most representative trophic categories were insectivores followed by frugivores. Of the species found, 11 are highly sensitive to human disturbances and 11 are endemic to the PCE. The bird community of the fragment is highly diversified, with endemic taxa and balanced trophic categories typical of preserved tropical forests. This community structure together with the occurrence of threatened species reinforces the importance of Mata do Cedro for the maintenance of local biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

Bird Study	65	1		114-122	2018	2018							Capsule: Although survival of nests was similar between forest fragments and continuous forest, the range of predators differed. Artificial nests provide an under-estimate of nest predation by snakes. Aims: To estimate the natural nest predation rate in continuous primary forest, compare it with predation rates in forest fragments. To assess the reliability of nest survival rates determined by the use of artificial nests with clay eggs and identify the main nest predators. Methods: We observed survival of natural nests during the incubation period in continuous primary forest in Papua New Guinea. Some nests were monitored with infrared cameras. We also used artificial nests deployed with clay eggs to identify predators. Results: There was a predation rate of 50% for natural nests and snakes were major predators of nest contents. Clutch daily survival rates (DSRs) differed among nest types. The DSR of artificial nests (0.977) was not significantly different to that of natural cup nests (0.969). Survival rates of artificial nests were similar in forest fragments and continuous forest. Forest fragments had, however, a higher proportion of avian predators than continuous forest. Conclusion: Although, we observed similar survival rates in artificial and natural nests, the composition of nest predators was different between natural and artificial nests. Artificial nests were not suitable for estimating the real predation caused by reptiles. Nevertheless, we find that participation of avian nest predators can be estimated correctly with the use of artificial nests.

Gardner, Allison M.; Muturi, Ephantus J.; Overmier, Leah D.; Allan, Brian F.				EcoHealth	14	4		750-761	Dec 2017	2017							Invasive species rank second only to habitat destruction as a threat to native biodiversity. One consequence of biological invasions is altered risk of exposure to infectious diseases in human and animal populations. The distribution and prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases depend on the complex interactions between the vector, the pathogen, and the human or wildlife reservoir host. These interactions are highly susceptible to disturbance by invasive species, including terrestrial plants. We conducted a 2-year field experiment using a Before-After/Control-Impact design to examine how removal of invasive Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) in a forest fragment embedded within a residential neighborhood affects the abundance of mosquitoes, including two of the most important vectors of West Nile virus, Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans. We also assessed any potential changes in avian communities and local microclimate associated with Amur honeysuckle removal. We found that (1) removal of Amur honeysuckle reduces the abundance of both vector and non-vector mosquito species that commonly feed on human hosts, (2) the abundance and composition of avian hosts is altered by honeysuckle removal, and (3) areas invaded with honeysuckle support local microclimates that are favorable to mosquito survival. Collectively, our investigations demonstrate the role of a highly invasive understory shrub in determining the abundance and distribution of mosquitoes and suggest potential mechanisms underlying this pattern. Our results also give rise to additional questions regarding the general impact of invasive plants on vector-borne diseases and the spatial scale at which removal of invasive plants may be utilized to effect disease control.

The line transect method was employed in 2002 and 2004 to estimate population densities and dominance of all bird species breeding in a selected fragment of such forest (eight transects with 165 sections and 77.7 km in total length). In total, 54 breeding bird species were recorded. The numbers varied between 37 and 44 on the particular transect. The number of breeding pairs per 10 ha varied on each transect from 41.0 to 93.6 (x=64.8; SD=102.22). Shannon's diversity index varied between 1.2 and 1.4 on particular transects, while Simpson's diversity index varied between 0.7 and 0.9. Also Pieleau's evenness index varied slightly between 0.05 and 0.07. In overall, the differences between densities of breeding species on 8 transects were not statistically significant. The Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs was by far the most numerous bird species, recorded as eudominant in all eight transects and present in all 165 sections. The second to the Chaffinch was the Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita; also recorded in all sections and as a dominant in all transects. Three other species, namely the Blackbird Turdus merula, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus and Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla were recorded each one in more than 90% sections (N=165), and on particular transects their dominance varied between 4 and 11%. Residents comprised 57.5% of all breeding pairs. Short-distance migrants were almost twice more common than long-distance migrants. Insectivores were by far the most numerous feeding guild represented 88.9% of all breeding pairs. Overall density, cumulative dominance, diversity and evenness were unexpectedly very similar in this study (managed forest) and in natural primeval lowland coniferous forests of Bialowieza.								2336-3193; 2336-3207								ZOOREC:ZOOR15403014538					J	ZOOR15402007696		Predators do not spill over from forest fragments to maize fields in a landscape mosaic in central Argentina.

Ecosystem services still remain important but their level and sustainability are not known. We quantified predation intensity in an Argentinian agricultural landscape containing remnants of the original chaco serrano forest using artificial sentinel prey. We sought to identify the main predators and the effect of landscape configuration and maize phenology on predation pressure by invertebrate and vertebrate predators in this landscape. The most common predators were chewing insects (50.4% predation events), birds (22.7%), and ants (17.5%). Overall predation rates in forest fragments (41.6% per day) were significantly higher than in the surrounding maize fields (21.5% per day). Invertebrate predation was higher inside and at the edge of forest fragments than within fields, and did not change with increasing distance from a fragment edge, indicating a lack of spillover from the native habitat remnants to the cultivated matrix at the local scale. Distance from a continuous forest had a positive impact on predation by invertebrates and a negative impact on vertebrate predation.

In this study, the presence of a grouse hen with a brood in a landscape was used to indicate habitat-related breeding success. We combined the locations of 938 black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), 388 capercaillie (T. urogallus), and 917 hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) broods after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data by employing Geographic Information System and grouse data derived from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1997-2004. Two large study areas with different landscape structures, northern forest-mire area and southern cultivated area, were selected for the investigation. The presence of grouse broods was positively related to the amount of old coniferous mixed forest. Grouse broods may prefer this forest habitat because of a rich understorey cover and a rich bilberry field layer offering a diversity of insects as food. Broods had a strong positive response to the amount of forest habitat. The effect of forest fragmentation on the broods' distribution did not increase even with decreasing forest habitat. We suggest that there are several ecological causes for the observed spatial correlations. Predation on nests and broods by generalist predators is presumably high in human-modified open and semi-open landscapes. Against our expectations, the effect of landscape composition on grouse broods was more marked in the northern than in the southern study area, most likely because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. This finding supports the alternative prey hypothesis. Further, large drained and reforested peatland mire areas had a negative impact on grouse broods in the north. In the drainage areas, decreased availability of vegetation cover and insect food, increased predation risk, and drowning of chicks in ditches may increase brood mortality.								2150-8925; 2150-8925								ZOOREC:ZOOR15408045952					J	ZOOR15403011424		Does plant diversity increase top-down control of herbivorous insects in tropical forest?		Leles, Bruno; Xiao, Xue; Pasion, Bonifacio O.; Nakamura, Akihiro; Tomlinson, Kyle W.				Oikos	126	8		1142-1149	Aug 2017	2017							Higher trophic level interactions are key mediators of ecosystem functioning in tropical forests. A rich body of theory has been developed to predict the effects of plant diversity on communities at higher trophic levels and the mechanisms underlying such effects. The 'enemies hypothesis' states that predators exert more effective top-down control of herbivorous insects with increasing plant diversity. Support for this hypothesis has been found in temperate forests and agroecosystems, but remains understudied in tropical forests. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies using artificial caterpillars in a tropical forest landscape and investigated the role of plant community structure (i.e. species richness, composition and density), and the role of forest fragmentation (i.e. patch size, edge distance and canopy openness) on predation intensity. Plant community effects were tested with respect to three vegetation strata: trees, saplings and herbs. Observed predation was substantially due to ants. Predation rates increased with plant species richness for trees and herbs. Density of saplings, herb cover and herb species composition were important factors for predation. No significant patterns were found for fragmentation parameters, suggesting that forest fragmentation has not altered predation intensity. We conclude that in tropical forests, top-down control of herbivorous insects in the understory vegetation is affected by a combination of plant diversity, plant species composition and structural features of the plant community.

The objective of this study was to record richness and abundance of bird communities in two semi-deciduous forest fragments in Brazil (Olavo Egydio Setubal - OES; and Igure - IGR). A subsequent analysis and comparison of the avifauna structure in each of the fragments were made including previous studies in the same areas. Point counts methodology was chosen for each fragment along 12 months. The results showed the occurrence of a total of 129 bird species for both areas. Although we registered 102 species for each site, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index, respectively, were slightly higher in OES (H' = 3.93; J' = 0.85) than in IGR (H' = 3.87; J' = 0.83). Among birds with various feeding habits, the highest percentage was recorded for understory insectivores in both areas. However, higher percentage of canopy frugivores was found in OES and higher percentage of canopy and understory nectarivores and canopy carnivores was registered in IGR. Moreover, in IGR higher abundance of omnivores was registered than in OES. On the other hand, in OES more specialist species were found while in IGR the percentage of generalist species was higher. Variations in diversity and evenness compared with three previous studies in the same areas showed higher values in the current study. Interestingly, the proportions of understory insectivores were maintained for both areas, however, in IGR higher percentage of omnivores and in OES more specialists than canopy frugivores and understory insectivores, respectively, were reported. Thus, in OES the specificity of feeding habits was maintained, but in IGR the percentage of generalists increased. This might be associated with the response to the edge effect which occurs in IGR's fragment, in particular due to the relation of shape versus size, which would determine its low perimeter.

Pablo Sanchez-Montenegro, Juan; Perez-Castillo, Katherine; Fernando Garces-Restrepo, Mario; Giraldo, Alan				Boletin Cientifico Museo de Historia Natural Universidad de Caldas	21	2		115-130	Jul 2017	2017							The transformation of ecosystems through human activities can affect the biological and ecological processes of bird species, and can even lead to groups of species becoming isolated due to deforestation, causing a decrease in genetic diversity and the extirpation of species. To evaluate the composition and structure of bird communities associated with the tropical dry forest ecosystem in the Guarinocito jurisdiction (La Victoria, Caldas) we identified two landscape units: a forest area (dry forest matrix) and an interfered area (matrix of lands), presenting human intervention such as roads and grassland systems. Point counts of 10 min long were carried out in each unit to survey birds between 06:00 and 09:00 hours and between 16:00 and 18:00 hours. Mist nets were set up to complete the species record. Three four-day long sampling trips were carried out in April 2013, November 2013, and October 2014 to consider the seasonal variability that affects the environmental conditions in the study area. The sampling representativeness was evaluated using non-parametric estimates. All observed or captured individuals were assigned to a trophic guild in order to evaluate the community structure in the two established landscape units. A total of 1,005 individuals from 36 families and 127 species were recorded. The most abundant species were Thraupis episcopus (7.36%) and Sicalis flaveola (6.77%). Sample representativeness ranged from 68.18% (Jack 2) to 86.03% (Bootstrap). Although no significant differences between the two landscape units were detected (THutchinson=1.59, p=0.81), species diversity was higher in the forested area than in the intervened area. The dominant trophic guild in both landscape units was that of insectivorous birds. No significant differences in bird community trophic structure were found between the two landscape units (X2= 14.60, p=0.33). The size, shape, or intervention history of the fragments could have resulted in a lack of differences in the structure and composition of the avifauna in the two landscape units.								0123-3068								ZOOREC:ZOOR15504019443					J	ZOOR15403016555		Body condition of five passerines in a forest fragment and associated factors.		Fernandes Teles, Daniella Reis; Dantas, Thais; de Melo, Celine				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	25	2		102-109	Jun 2017	2017							Body condition is a qualitative evaluation of an animal and is directly related to its fitness, with the relative mass index (RMI) as a tool for indirect estimation of energy reserves. This study evaluated if the body condition of birds differs between guilds, if it is reflected in levels of subcutaneous fat, and if it is influenced by the weather season and ectoparasite presence. The RMI was calculated for Antilophia galeata (frugivorous), Arremon flavirostris, Eucometis penicillata (omnivorous), Basileuterus culicivorus, and Myiothlypis leucophrys (insectivorous). It varied among guilds (F2, 295 = 187.92; P < 0.05), with insectivorous species having negative values. The RMI varied between the wet and dry seasons only for A. galeata (F1, 1 = 7.28; P < 0.05) but remained positive throughout the year in omnivorous species. The RMI did not vary with the presence/absence of ectoparasites nor among the different levels of subcutaneous fat, which were predominantly low. The negative RMI of insectivores and its variation in frugivorous between seasons suggest that the body condition is influenced by the type of diet and the availability of food resources, indicating that birds with a specialized diet may be more sensitive to environmental variations that result in fluctuations in the food supply.

Bare, Matthew C.; Danner, Raymond M.				Ecological Restoration	35	2		102-111	Jun 2017	2017							Secondary forests have reclaimed one sixth of deforested land worldwide, and much of this revegetated forest lies in agricultural and increasingly semi-urban landscapes. While, many studies have described faunal populations such as birds across forest-agricultural landscapes, they generally note minor changes in total species richness and more significant changes in species composition. Few studies, however, consider faunal diversity among secondary forests of different management history, such as manual restoration or natural revegetation. In this study, we surveyed bird communities in three forest sites of varying restoration and natural revegetation treatments in a tropical urban-agricultural landscape in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our sites include manually restored and naturally revegetating forest of 20-40 years since clearing. We found that a diverse assemblage of birds visit and occupy forest fragments within the urban-agricultural landscape, including two IUCN-listed near-threatened species. Bird species richness was similar across sites of different management history; species composition varied only slightly, but differences existed in presence and occupancy for forest-dependent groups, such as large frugivores and forest insectivores. In the manually restored site, bird diversity may have been limited by under-developed forest structure, but we were unable to isolate the effects of patch size and landscape matrix. We suggest that future restoration activities consider forest structure in addition to plant species diversity when attempting to restore faunal populations, and that future studies take heed of landscape and matrix parameters when evaluating restoration projects.								1522-4740								ZOOREC:ZOOR15312075622					J	ZOOR15311068340		Fragmentation gradients differentially affect the species range distributions of four taxonomic groups in semi-deciduous Atlantic forest.		da Silva, Fernando R.; Rossa-Feres, Denise de Cerqueira				Biotropica	49	3		283-292	May 2017	2017							Human activities often cause habitat fragmentation and how forest fragments affect species range distributions has implications for ecology and conservation. However, few studies have considered communities within the same landscape. Here, we analyzed metacommunity structure to determine the range distributions for species in four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, social wasps, and trees) in a patchy landscape of semi-deciduous Atlantic forest in southwestern Brazil. Although trees are a key component of the environment for animals in forested patches, the ranges of bird, wasp, and amphibian species did not change in concert with the species ranges of trees. The species ranges of amphibians and social wasps were unaffected by fragmentation gradients and exhibited independent distribution patterns (i.e., random structure). In contrast, birds and trees exhibited range turnover along different fragmentation gradients, indicating that species show idiosyncratic responses to abiotic factors (i.e., Gleasonian structure). For birds, some less-resilient species occurred only in fragments with a large area of native vegetation at a radius of 5km from the center of the sampled forest fragments, whereas other more stress-tolerant species occurred only in sites with small areas of native vegetation. For trees, some later succession species (e.g., animal-dispersed seeds) occurred only in fragments with high connectivity, whereas earlier-recruiting species (e.g., wind-dispersed seeds) occurred in fragments with low connectivity. Thus, determining the effects of human-modified landscapes on species range distributions, even within the same landscape, might not be a trivial task.

Smith, David A. Ehlers; Smith, Yvette C. Ehlers; Downs, Colleen T.				Forest Ecology and Management	390			157-165	Apr 15 2017	2017							The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest is extremely biodiverse but is threatened by anthropogenic land-use change. In South Africa, remnant forest patches are divided into highly restricted but protected indigenous forest (IF) and abundant but unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush (DB), which likely represents secondary/regenerating IF. We tested the hypothesis that DB had value for conserving forest dependent avian taxonomic and functional diversity, as (a) DB is situated with in the forestanthropogenic land-use mosaic and (b) birds maintain diverse ecosystem functions and are sensitive to environmental change given their varied biological traits. We conducted 149 and 112 fixed-radius point-count surveys of avian communities in 99, and 24, patches of DB and IF, respectively, at each location recording microhabitat vegetation structure. We compared vegetation characteristics and taxonomic species richness between vegetation classes, and tested the breadth of functional trait-space and for significant associations with vegetation structures at each survey location, using RLQ analysis. Vegetation classes differed significantly, but floral species overlap and vegetation structures in DB closely resembled regenerating IF habitat. Specialist ground-nesting and insect-gleaning species corresponded to taller, more diverse IF structures. Other biological traits and total species richness overlapped broadly across both classes, but IF had significantly higher mean species richness. Given the relatively high taxonomic and functional diversity of the avian community in the abundant DB, the scarcity of IF, and the proximity of DB to the anthropogenic land-use mosaic, we recommend allocating suitable DB patches to the Protected Area Network, which may simultaneously help preserve avian taxonomic and functional diversity, facilitate colonisation throughout the fragmented landscape and provide ecosystem services to anthropogenic land uses.

Olivier, Pieter I.; van Aarde, Rudi J.				Biotropica	49	2		268-278	Mar 2017	2017							South African coastal forests form part of two critically endangered eco-regions and harbor an extinction debt. Remaining fragments are small, isolated, and embedded within a range of human land-use types. In this study, we ask: how should we invest conservation resources if we want to restore this landscape and prevent predicted extinctions? To answer this question, we use path analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects of forest area, forest connectivity, and matrix land-use types on species richness within five bird feeding guilds. We found that forest connectivity had a significant direct effect on insectivoresfragments that were more connected had more species of insectivores than those that were isolated. Moreover, forest area had a significant indirect effect on insectivores that was mediated through tree species richness. Larger fragments had more species of trees, which led to more species of insectivores. Fragment area, connectivity, matrix land-use type, and tree species richness had no significant effects on the species richness of frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, or generalist feeders. To conserve insectivores in coastal forests, conservation efforts should focus on maximizing fragment connectivity across the landscape, but also protect the tree community within fragments from degradation. This can be achieved by including matrix habitats that adjoin forest fragments within forest conservation and restoration plans. Natural matrix habitats can increase connectivity, provide supplementary resources, buffer fragments from degradation, and could play an important role in safeguarding diversity and preventing extinctions in this threatened human-modified landscape.								0006-3606								ZOOREC:ZOOR15309054219					J	ZOOR15307039747		Habitat and food supply across multiple spatial scales influence the distribution and abundance of a nocturnal aerial insectivore.		English, Philina A.; Nocera, Joseph J.; Pond, Bruce A.; Green, David J.				Landscape Ecology	32	2		343-359	Feb 2017	2017							Conservation research often focuses on individual threats at a single spatial scale, but population declines can result from multiple stressors occurring at different spatial scales. Analyses incorporating alternative hypotheses across spatial scales allow more robust evaluation of the ecological processes underlying population declines. Populations of many aerially insectivorous birds are declining, yet conservation efforts remain focused on habitat due to an absence of data on changes in prey availability. We evaluate the potential for prey and habitat availability at multiple spatial scales to influence a population of eastern whip-poor-wills (Antrostomus vociferous). We assess relationships between landcover (topographical map and satellite imagery) and insect abundance (moths and beetles from blacklight traps), and whip-poor-will distribution and abundance within eastern Canada using Ontario breeding bird atlas data (1980s and 2000s), acoustic recordings (regional), and point counts (local). Whip-poor-will occurrence in both atlas time periods was positively associated with forest area and fragmentation, but only a delayed effect of urban area explained reductions in detection. Contemporary regional whip-poor-will presence was positively related to moth abundance, and local whip-poor-will abundance was best predicted by area of open-canopy forest, anthropogenic linear disturbance density, and beetle abundance. Our finding that bird presence and abundance were associated with human activity and insect abundance across spatial scales suggests factors beyond habitat structure are likely driving population declines in whip-poor-wills and other aerial insectivores. This study demonstrates the importance of examining multiple hypotheses, including seasonally and locally variable food availability, across a range of spatial scales to direct conservation efforts.

Schmid, Sandrine; Dinkel, Anke; Mackenstedt, Ute; Tantely, Michael Luciano; Randrianambinintsoa, Fano Jose; Boyer, Sebastien; Woog, Friederike				Parasites & Vectors	10			6	Jan 5 2017	2017							Background: Avian malaria occurs almost worldwide and is caused by Haemosporida parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon). Vectors such as mosquitoes, hippoboscid flies or biting midges are required for the transmission of these parasites. There are few studies about avian malaria parasites on Madagascar but none about suitable vectors. Methods: To identify vectors of avian Plasmodium parasites on Madagascar, we examined head, thorax and abdomen of 418 mosquitoes from at least 18 species using a nested PCR method to amplify a 524 bp fragment of the haemosporidian mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Sequences obtained were then compared with a large dataset of haemosporidian sequences detected in 45 different bird species (n = 686) from the same area in the Maromizaha rainforest. Results: Twenty-one mosquitoes tested positive for avian malaria parasites. Haemoproteus DNA was found in nine mosquitoes (2.15%) while Plasmodium DNA was found in 12 mosquitoes (2.87%). Seven distinct lineages were identified among the Plasmodium DNA samples. Some lineages were also found in the examined bird samples: Plasmodium sp. WA46 (EU810628.1) in the Madagascar bulbul, Plasmodium sp. mosquito 132 (AB308050.1) in 15 bird species belonging to eight families, Plasmodium sp. PV12 (GQ150194.1) in eleven bird species belonging to eight families and Plasmodium sp. P31 (DQ839060.1) was found in three weaver bird species. Conclusion: This study provides the first insight into avian malaria transmission in the Maromizaha rainforest in eastern Madagascar. Five Haemoproteus lineages and seven Plasmodium lineages were detected in the examined mosquitoes. Complete life-cycles for the specialist lineages WA46 and P31 and for the generalist lineages mosquito132 and PV12 of Plasmodium are proposed. In addition, we have identified for the first time Anopheles mascarensis and Uranotaenia spp. as vectors for avian malaria and offer the first description of vector mosquitoes for avian malaria in Madagascar.

Forest fragments around Budongo Forest Reserve, an Important Bird Area in western Uganda, were surveyed to explore the effects of different aspects of habitat fragmentation on bird guild composition. We recorded 1 128 individuals of 75 bird species over 7 056 net hours. The greatest number of birds and species were recorded in the forest fragments that were large, near to the continuous forest and surrounded by subsistence farmland. However, rarefied species richness was not affected by distance, size or matrix type; instead, forest specialist species were replaced by generalists and visitors with increasing fragmentation. The proportion of forest specialists and of terrestrial insectivores decreased with distance from the main forest, canopy openness and matrix intensity but not with fragment area. The findings show that bird assemblages vary in their response to habitat fragmentation but within guilds the response to fragmentation can be consistent, and can make ecological sense. Forest bird conservation can therefore benefit from information on species ecology when deciding which bird species and which parts of the landscape are to be prioritised for conservation or monitoring purposes.

Souza, Marcos Magalhaes; Brunismann, Angela Gomes; Pires, Epifanio Porfiro				EntomoBrasilis	10	1		51-53	2017	2017							The success of social wasps is highly dependent on nest construction and colony maintenance. Species use different strategies to avoid nest predation, including forming associations with other insects and vertebrates. This study describes for the first time the association between the social wasp Chartergus globiventris Saussure and the yellow-olive flycatcher Tolmomyias sulphureseens Spix in a deciduous seasonal forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. We located eight active. C. globiventris colonies in the study site, three of which were. associated with active T. sulphureseens nests. Bird-wasp associations in previous studies have been regarded as commensalism because only birds seem to benefit. However, further studies are needed to better understand the potential benefits of this relationship for both taxa.								1983-0572								ZOOREC:ZOOR15310062915					J	ZOOR15309060674		PREDATOR PLAYBACK, FORAGING HEIGHT, AND PHYLOGENY AFFECT GAP CROSSING BEHAVIOR IN TROPICAL FOREST BIRDS.		Williamson, Jessie L.; Fagan, Matthew E.				Ornitologia Neotropical	28			163-174	2017	2017							The effects of fragmented landscapes on tropical bird movements remain poorly understood, partly due to a dearth of experimental tests of gap crossing behavior. To learn more about the factors involved in gap crossing behavior, we used predator-playback experiments on four species of understory-insectivore birds (Chestnut-backed Antbird Poliocrania exsul, Black-crowned Antshrike Thamnophilus atrinucha, White-breasted Wood-wren Henicorhina leucosticta, Stripe-breasted Wren Cantorchilus thoracicus) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We sought to understand species-and family-level differences in gap crossing behavior, specifically: (1) the effect of forest-opening (gap) width, and (2) the effect of perceived risk of predation. A total of 39 treatment (predator playback) and 39 control (silent playback) trials were conducted at gap sites ranging in width from 2.8 to 12.6 m. Predator playback decreased the number of times that birds crossed study gaps, increased latency time in all but one species, and increased the closest distance that birds approached the playback speaker. Gap width affected only latency time: as gap width increased, latency time increased. We observed strong differences in behavioral response between families and species of different foraging heights. In the statistical models, family (Thamnophilidae and Troglodytidae), foraging height (low or mid-story), and trial type (silent control or predator treatment) consistently emerged as strongest predictors of bird behavior. Our results indicate that small linear gaps (< 12.6 m) do not impede movement for these four focal species, but that risk of predation may hinder bird movement even at small gaps.

Knowlton, Jessie L.; Phifer, Colin C.; Cerqueira, Pablo V.; Barro, Fernanda de Carvalho; Oliveira, Samuel L.; Fiser, Cynthia M.; Becker, Nia M.; Cardoso, Maira R.; Flaspohler, David J.; Dantas Santos, Marcos Persio				Tropical Conservation Science	10			1-10	2017	2017							Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a rapidly expanding crop in the Amazonian region of Brazil. Brazilian law requires all landowners, including oil palm plantations, to maintain forest reserves and forested riparian corridors as a way to limit biodiversity losses. Because of these laws and the forest-like structure of oil palm, these plantations may function as habitat for some native species in the region. We tested this assumption by experimentally translocating Cinereous Antshrikes (Thamnomanes caesius), a forest understory insectivorous bird and nuclear member of mixed-species flocks, from forest reserves to riparian corridors within a large oil palm plantation landscape and tracked their movements back to their home ranges. In total, we recorded the movements of 18 individuals, 8 of which were translocated. The other 10 individuals were tracked within their home ranges in the forest reserves. Six of the eight translocated birds successfully returned to their forest home range, but only one bird flew through the more direct route back through the oil palm matrix while the rest took longer routes through adjoining riparian corridors. Homing time for translocated birds averaged 9.57 ([plus or minus]2.23 SE) days. The home range of birds within the forest reserves averaged 2.39 ([plus or minus]0.69 SE) ha, and, with the exception of the single returning bird, Cinereous Antshrikes were never detected in oil palm. Our results suggest that oil palm plantations are a barrier to movements of our study species, and that riparian corridors connecting forest fragments may be effective routes for dispersal.

Ribon, Romulo; Marini, Miguel A.				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	24	4		303-313	Dec 2016	2016							Demographic parameters of birds are essential to understand their ecology and delineate conservation and management plans. This becomes especially important in highly altered biomes such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, since the few remaining fragments bear mostly secondary forests where demographic parameters might differ from old-growth forests. Few studies about territory sizes and density have been conducted for entire bird communities or groups of species in the Neotropical region, with a bias towards Central America and the Amazon. In this work we determined territories of Atlantic Forest birds in order to assess their size and density. We conducted spot-mapping in a rectangular 40-ha plot within a 384-ha of secondary semideciduous forest fragment in Vicosa region, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We identified 260 territories of 30 species of insectivorous birds. Mean territory size of all species was 2.4 ha, ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 ha. The mean density for all species was 21.7 pairs/100 ha, ranging from 2.5 to 72.5 pairs. The sizes of the territories of many Atlantic Forest birds were by far smaller, and the density higher, than those of conspecific or congeneric species from Amazonian or Central American forests. These geographical differences in territory size and density can be explained by at least two non-exclusive hypotheses: 1) higher primary and secondary productivity in advanced successional secondary forest fragments and; 2) density compensation, given the loss of other competitor species.

Czeszczewik, Dorota; Walankiewicz, Wieslaw				Lesne Prace Badawcze	77	4		332-340	Dec 2016	2016							The aim of this study was to review the most important results from the last 40 years of intense ornithological research conducted in the Bialowieza Forest. Furthermore, we discuss the threats that may destroy the unique ecology and characteristics of this forest. Studying the avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest provides us with a good general knowledge about natural ecological conditions and relationships, which prevailed in temperate European forests in the past. The avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest is characterized by features associated with primeval habitats such as the stability of communities over time, high species richness, relatively low densities, high proportion of hole-nesting birds, very high predation pressure and weak, insignificant competition interactions. This emphasizes the importance of predation, excess of nesting sites for cavity nesting birds, high abundance of food, especially for insectivorous species and fluctuation of bird population size due to rodent outbreaks (pulsed resources). The most severe threats for the avifauna of the Bialowieza Forest are: rejuvenation of tree stands, removal of dead wood, fragmentation of old-growth stands, change of tree stand composition (reducing the proportion of some tree species). In order to expand our ecological knowledge about birds, we should keep the Bialowieza Forest fully protected for years to come. The main priority should be the maintenance of natural processes changing the forest's species composition.								1732-9442								ZOOREC:ZOOR15307039939					J	ZOOR15307043469		Note on the diet of the Long-whiskered Owlet, Xenoglaux loweryi from Yambrasbamba, Amazonas.

We examined the influence of route 32 (a.k.a. Guapiles Highway) on temporal and spatial changes in the structure of the avifauna of Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica, a site crossed by this road along 25 km. The highway connects the capital city of San Jose with the Harbor of Limon in the Caribbean Sea (142 km). Although the road is narrow (12 m in width and comprised by two lanes along most of the route) it services over 1.5 million motor vehicles per year, 12 % are heavy trucks and trailers. We expected the highway to divide the avifauna, and thus to observe significant differences in species structure on opposite sides of the road. We described changes in bird diversity between wet and dry seasons at Las Palmas and Ceibo trails located on opposite sides of the highway (14 point counts per trail), and evaluated how abundance and diversity varied with road distance. Censuses took place during wet and dry seasons from 2002 to 2005. We listed 245 species and 6 035 observations during the 4-yr survey. Rare species dominated the avifauna (65 % of species < 5 observations), and species overlap between trails was high (Sorensen= 71 %; Morisita= 0.96). Species accumulation curves varied little among trails, yielding 190 species. Resident species represented 70 % of observations, followed by elevational (15 %) and long-distance migrants (1-2 %). Understory species were the most abundant (60 %) followed by canopy birds (30 %). Species turnover rate was 55 % between seasons, but species composition between trails remained homogeneous. Overall, birds were avoiding the road (abundance increased away from the road) although other diversity parameters (richness, dominance, Shannon index, and equitability) were not influenced by road proximity. Although the avifauna remained homogeneous on both sides of the road, which did not support the fragmentation hypothesis, the highway reduced the abundance and diversity of specialized understory insectivores associated with primary forests near the road. This highway will expand outside the National Park (from 2 to 4 lanes along 107 km from Rio Frio to Limon) in the next years, which will increase traffic volume and road impacts within the Park. Roads are increasing across highly diverse tropical areas justifying the need for management practices based on the identification of sensitive groups.

Dodonov, Pavel; Morante-Filho, Jose Carlos; Mariano-Neto, Eduardo; Cazetta, Eliana; de Andrade, Edyla Ribeiro; Rocha-Santos, Larissa; Inforzato, Igor; Gomes, Francisco Sanches; Faria, Deborah				Acta Oecologica	77			136-143	Nov 2016	2016							Insect herbivory has been observed to be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, although the mechanisms by which these anthropogenic disturbances affect this process are not well understood. To aid in clarifying this issue, we assessed the relation between forest cover and leaf damage caused by herbivorous insects on a representative tropical forest understory plant family, the Rubiaceae. We measured leaf area loss of Rubiaceae plants in 20 forest sites located in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and also tested whether variation in forest cover, abundance of insectivorous birds (predators) and of Rubiaceae plants (resources) could explain the observed variation in leaf damage. Herbivory levels varied between 2.6 and 12.5 percent leaf area lost and increased with decreasing forest cover, whereas the other explanatory variables did not provide additional explanatory power. Therefore, forest loss appears to be the main driver of changes in local herbivory, and ecological processes such as top-down and bottom-up control may not account for the deforestation-related increase in herbivory levels. Other mechanisms, for example leaf quality and/or the influence of the adjoining land uses, have to be explored in future studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Willrich, Guilherme; Calsavara, Larissa Corsini; Lima, Marcos Robalinho; de Oliveira, Renan Campos; Bochio, Gabriela Menezes; Medina Rosa, Gabriel Lima; Muzi, Vanildo Cesar; dos Anjos, Luiz				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	24	3		235-259	Sep 2016	2016							Human activities have modified landscapes worldwide, promoting fragmentation and isolation of forest habitats. Such landscape modifications are responsible for changes in species composition due to extinction and colonization events. Forest species dynamism is usually affected by forest fragmentation when remaining fragments are small and isolated, but forest dynamism is usually more stable when forest fragments are large and connected. In this study we verified changes in bird composition during 23 years of bird monitoring at the Mata dos Godoy State Park (PEMG). We aimed to evaluate the avian community dynamism of this reserve, as well as its effectiveness in protecting biodiversity in an extremely fragmented landscape. We reviewed historical records of bird species composition and checked for any possible misidentifications, updated the list and created an annual data set of bird species occurrence. We used this list to evaluate species persistence, species loss, and colonization over the study period. Additionally, species were classified according to their guilds in order to determine which species traits were associated with local extinction. A total of 331 bird species were recorded in PEMG over 23 years of monitoring, 17 of which were considered locally extinct or possibly extinct, and 11 were recent local colonizations. This indicates that bird composition in PEMG has been relatively stable over the years. However, local extinction was more likely for large frugivores and insectivores, which are guilds already known to be more susceptible to local extinction. Colonizations, in turn, were associated with guilds of more open habitats, like edge insectivores. We suggest that extinctions and colonizations are also potentially related to species distribution ranges and climate change. Although local extinctions occurred, PEMG still maintains a significant fraction of its historical avifauna and may potentially maintain source populations for many bird species, thus making it an important reserve for the north of Parana.

Pacheco Coelho, Marco Tulio; Raniero, Mariana; Silva, Marina Isidoro; Hasui, Erica				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	128	3		520-534	Sep 2016	2016							In the current scenario of human transformation of natural landscapes, fragmentation and habitat loss is considered one of the major threats to biodiversity. The characteristics of altered landscapes and remaining habitat patches influence the persistence of species and, as a direct consequence, the functioning of ecological processes. The main focus of studies at landscape scale is to understand how human modifications in natural areas lead to changes in abundance and richness of species. However, such approaches do not directly describe the functional composition of communities, nor do they describe the functional responses to fragmentation and habitat loss. Birds are an interesting taxonomic group to explore this theme, since they present important, broadly-described ecological functions for human modified habitats (e.g., seed dispersal, pollination, and insect pest control). Thus, we aimed to explore the functional responses of birds to landscape characteristics. We selected 14 human modified landscapes of Atlantic forest, found within a radius of 30 km of Alfenas, Brazil. Each landscape was characterized by metrics describing landscape configuration and composition, such as forest percentage and mean connectivity. Birds were sampled in the central patches of the landscapes and classified into 15 functional groups, based on species' traits. We constructed Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to identify the best models that explained the abundance and richness of species in each functional group. Few groups had high functional redundancy, showing the fragility of the majority of functional groups in the current modified landscapes. Forest dependent functional groups were favored by connected landscapes, higher percentage of forest cover, and high percentages of coffee matrix. On the other hand, forest independent groups were favored by irregular habitat areas and negatively impacted by forest cover and sugar cane matrices. Consistent management of altered landscapes, based on functional responses, can assist the recovery and maintenance of natural areas. We highlight the complexity involved in landscape management, considering it requires simultaneous work on composition and configuration.

Bett, Mark Cheruiyot; Muchai, Muchane; Waweru, Catherine				African Journal of Ecology	54	3		342-348	Sep 2016	2016							Forest fragmentation and degradation leads to formation of modified habitats whose ability to support existing avifaunal diversity is still largely unknown. Bird diversity in indigenous forest, disturbed forest, plantation forest and farmlands adjacent to North Nandi Forest reserve was studied between January 2015 and June 2015. The distribution of bird feeding guilds in these habitat patches was also evaluated. Birds were surveyed using point counts, timed species counts and line transects and classified into six feeding guilds. A total of 3,232 individual birds of 151 species were recorded in the four habitats. Significant difference on bird abundance across the four habitats (F = 15.141, P <= 0.05, df = 3, 1121) was noted. Shannon-Weiner diversity index H' for bird community ranged from 3.06 for plantation forest to 4.05 for disturbed forest showing a relatively diverse bird community. Insectivores (F = 3.090, P <= 0.05, df = 3, 297) dominated the foraging species assemblage in all the habitats significantly. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong linear relationship on bird species richness and abundance with vegetation variables (P < 0.01 in all cases). The results indicate that disturbed forest and indigenous forest support high bird species richness than plantation forest and farmlands. However, high bird abundance was observed in farmlands and plantation forest as opposed to indigenous forest and disturbed forest as they provide dispersal routes over a short distance and are important for creating corridors between primary forests.

Terraube, Julien; Archaux, Frederic; Deconchat, Marc; van Halder, Inge; Jactel, Herve; Barbaro, Luc				Ecology and Evolution	6	15		5178-5189	Aug 2016	2016							A major conservation challenge in mosaic landscapes is to understand how trait-specific responses to habitat edges affect bird communities, including potential cascading effects on bird functions providing ecosystem services to forests, such as pest control. Here, we examined how bird species richness, abundance and community composition varied from interior forest habitats and their edges into adjacent open habitats, within a multi-regional sampling scheme. We further analyzed variations in Conservation Value Index (CVI), Community Specialization Index (CSI) and functional traits across the forest-edge-open habitat gradient. Bird species richness, total abundance and CVI were significantly higher at forest edges while CSI peaked at interior open habitats, i.e., furthest from forest edge. In addition, there were important variations in trait-and species-specific responses to forest edges among bird communities. Positive responses to forest edges were found for several forest bird species with unfavorable conservation status. These species were in general insectivores, understorey gleaners, cavity nesters and long-distance migrants, all traits that displayed higher abundance at forest edges than in forest interiors or adjacent open habitats. Furthermore, consistently with predictions, negative edge effects were recorded in some forest specialist birds and in most open-habitat birds, showing increasing densities from edges to interior habitats. We thus suggest that increasing landscape-scale habitat complexity would be beneficial to declining species living in mosaic landscapes combining small woodlands and open habitats. Edge effects between forests and adjacent open habitats may also favor bird functional guilds providing valuable ecosystem services to forests in long-standing fragmented landscapes.

Aurelio-Silva, Marco; Anciaes, Marina; Pinto Henriques, Luiza Magalli; Benchimol, Maira; Peres, Carlos A.				Biological Conservation	199			101-109	Jul 2016	2016							Mega-hydroelectric dams in lowland Amazonia create large archipelagos of upland forest, yet few studies have taken advantage of these fragmented landscapes to examine the effects of habitat insularization on vertebrate populations. We investigated the effects of insularization on bird species richness and composition at 27 variable-sized islands formed by the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon after 25 years of isolation, which were compared to three mainland sites in adjacent continuous forest. Islands were characterized by patch and landscape metrics, and the local avifauna was surveyed at all sites (including 172 sampling points) four times using point counts, and twice using playbacks. Island size was the strongest predictor of species richness and similarity, whereas other metrics showed weak or no effect. On the basis of 61 forest bird species distributed across six foraging guilds, terrestrial omnivores and insectivores, small understorey frugivores and large-bodied trunk frugivore/faunivore comprised the guilds most affected by habitat insularization. Our results demonstrate a striking decline in avifaunal species richness, particularly in islands smaller than 55 ha, which represent [approximately]90% of the [approximately]3500 islands in the Balbina reservoir. We conclude that other major hydropower reservoirs across the lowland Amazonian basin are likely to experience similarly high avian extinction rates and suggest that the environmental licencing of these impoundments should be reassessed or at least include protected area offsets.

Fagan, Matthew E.; DeFries, Ruth S.; Sesnie, Steven E.; Arroyo-Mora, J. Pablo; Chazdon, Robin L.				Ecological Applications	26	5		1456-1474	Jul 2016	2016							Re-establishing connectivity between protected areas isolated by habitat clearing is a key conservation goal in the humid tropics. In northeastern Costa Rica, payments for environmental services (PES) and a government ban on deforestation have subsidized forest protection and reforestation in the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLSBC), resulting in a decline in mature forest loss and the expansion of tree plantations. We use field studies and graph models to assess how conservation efforts have altered functional connectivity over the last 25 years for four species of insectivorous understory birds. Field playback studies assessed how reforestation habitat quality affected the willingness of Myrmeciza exsul, Henicorhina leucosticta, Thamnophilus atrinucha, and Glyphorynchus spirurus to travel outside forest habitat for territorial defense. Observed travel distances were greatest in non-native and native tree plantations with high understory stem density, regardless of overstory composition. In contrast, tree plantations with low stem density had travel responses comparable to open pasture for three of the four bird species. We modeled landscape connectivity for each species using graph models based on varying possible travel distances in tree plantations, gallery forests, and pastures. From 1986 to 2011, connectivity for all species declined in the SJLSBC landscape (5825 km2) by 14% to 21% despite only a 4.9% net loss in forest area and the rapid expansion of tree plantations over 2% of the landscape. Plantation placement in the landscape limited their potential facilitation of connectivity because they were located either far from forest cover or within already contiguous forest areas. We mapped current connectivity bottlenecks and identified priority areas for future reforestation. We estimate that reforestation of priority areas could improve connectivity by 2% with only a 1% gain in forest cover, an impressive gain given the small area reforested. Results indicate key locations where spatial targeting of PES within the SJLSBC study region would protect existing forest connectivity and enhance the connectivity benefits of reforestation.								1051-0761								ZOOREC:ZOOR15209059691	27755750				J	ZOOR15209058864		Generalist birds promote tropical forest regeneration and increase plant diversity via rare-biased seed dispersal.		Carlo, Tomas A.; Morales, Juan M.				Ecology (Washington D C)	97	7		1819-1831	Jul 2016	2016							Regenerated forests now compose over half of the world's tropical forest cover and are increasingly important as providers of ecosystem services, freshwater, and biodiversity conservation. Much of the value and functionality of regenerating forests-depends on the plant diversity they contain. Tropical forest diversity is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions between plants and fruit-eating animals (frugivores) that disperse seeds. Here we show how seed dispersal by birds can influence the speed and diversity of early successional forests in Puerto Rico. For two years, we monitored the monthly fruit production of bird-dispersed plants on a fragmented landscape, and measured seed dispersal activity of birds and plant establishment in experimental plots located in deforested areas. Two predominantly omnivorous bird species, the Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) and the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis), proved critical for speeding up the establishment of woody plants and increasing the species richness and diversity of the seed rain in deforested areas. Seed dispersal by these generalists increased the odds for rare plant species to disperse and establish in experimental forest-regeneration plots. Results indicate that birds that mix fruit and insects in their diets and actively forage across open and forested habitats can play keystone roles in the regeneration of mutualistic plant-animal communities. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that rare-biased (antiapostatic) frugivory and seed dispersal is the mechanism responsible for increasing plant diversity in the early-regenerating community.

Kutt, Alex S.; Vanderduys, Eric P.; Perry, Justin J.; Mathieson, Michael T.; Eyre, Teresa J.				Austral Ecology	41	3		316-327	May 2016	2016							In Australia, the role of noisy miners Manorina melanocephala in biotic homogenization of the avifauna has been well established in modified landscapes, and is listed as a threatening process under national conservation legislation. However, less is known about the effect of the congeneric and more widely distributed yellow-throated miner, M.flavigula. In this paper we investigate the relative roles of habitat loss and increased dominance by the yellow-throated miner in avian homogenization and species functional group decline. We examined bird community data collected from 368 woodland sites across three bioregions. For each site there was a local and a landscape scale measure of remnant vegetation cover. We used both multivariate and regression analysis to test the relative influence of yellow-throated miner abundance and vegetation on bird community composition. There was clear compositional change and homogenization of the avifauna where yellow-throated miners were present and vegetation cover was low. The abundance of 40 bird species was predicted by combinations of vegetation cover or yellow-throated miner abundance, and 31 of these regressions included the term yellow-throated miner. Of these, there was a negative relationship with 23 species, and 19 of these were insectivores or nectarivores. We postulate that the combination of clearing and yellow-throated miner abundance can interact to disrupt the ecological function of woodlands, by the depletion of insect- and nectar-feeding species and the disturbance to mixed feeding flocks. We propose future research objectives that include a continental-scale analysis of the determinants of yellow-throated miner overabundance, the numerical and geographical thresholds of their potential impacts, and the ecological consequences on both avifauna and the woodlands they inhabit.

Scherer, Cedric; Jeltsch, Florian; Grimm, Volker; Blaum, Niels				Ecological Modelling	326			75-89	Apr 24 2016	2016							Climate change and land use management practices are major drivers of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To understand and predict resulting changes in community structures, individual-based and spatially explicit population models are a useful tool but require detailed data sets for each species. More generic approaches are thus needed. Here we present a trait-based functional type approach to model savanna birds. The aim of our model is to explore the response of different bird functional types to modifications in habitat structure. The functional types are characterized by different traits, in particular body mass, which is related to life-history traits (reproduction and mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and dispersal ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in artificial landscapes varying in shrub: grass ratio and clumping intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and omnivores were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment compared to small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas herbivorous and carnivorous birds were most affected by a decreasing amount of grass cover. From an applied point of view, our findings emphasize that policies such as woody plant removal and a reduction in livestock stocking rates to prevent shrub encroachment should prioritize the enlargement of existing grassland patches. Overall, our results show that the combination of an individual-based modelling approach with carefully defined functional types can provide a powerful tool for exploring biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, the increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on species' core and soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly) on one side and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for animal functional types on the other side will further improve functional type approaches which consider the sensitivities of multiple species to climate change, habitat loss, and fragmentation.

Santiago-Alarcon, Diego; MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Kuehnert, Katharina; Segelbacher, Gernot; Schaefer, H. Martin				Urban Ecosystems	19	1		331-346	Mar 2016	2016							Urbanization has been identified as a threat to biodiversity due to landscape modifications. Studies of parasite ecology in urbanized areas lagged behind those made on macro organisms. Here we studied infection prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in an avian community of an urban forest from Germany, and its relationship with bird abundance and body mass. We used PCR to amplify a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b gene to determine the infection status of birds, and bird point counts to determine bird relative abundances. The avifauna was dominated by two small sized insectivore passerines (Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus), representing [approximately]40 % of the total bird records. The highest haemosporidian prevalence was recorded for Turdus philomelos (100 %) and for Fringilla coelebs (75 %). Bird abundance and body mass were positively associated with infection status for two haemosporidian genera: Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon. Infection rate was lower in juveniles compared to adult birds. We recorded a total of 7 Plasmodium, 26 Haemoproteus, and 10 Leucocytozoon lineages. Avian malaria (P. relictum) was detected infecting 5 individuals of P. major, the most abundant species in the community. These results, together with those of previous studies at the same site, suggest that potentially any of the genetic haemosporidian lineages detected in this urban forest can be transmitted across native and pet bird species, and to species of conservation concern housed at aviaries.

However, studies using historical, empirical data to understand species responses to climate change and anthropogenic habitat disturbance remain scarce, especially for tropical mountain ecosystems. Here, we compare historical to recent mist net data to study changes in abundance of forest understorey birds along two elevational gradients. Location Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Methods We investigate patterns of understorey bird abundance along elevational and disturbance gradients on two slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro between 1991 and 2011. To understand species responses to climate change and disturbance, we use a trait-based approach. Specifically, we test whether and how species' traits (temperature, habitat and dietary preferences) affect species responses to environmental change. Results We found that over the 20-year time interval, mean minimum temperature increased across all sites along the elevational gradient, while levels of habitat disturbance remained similar. Mean abundance of understorey bird species increased significantly, especially at higher elevations and on the southern slope. Temporal increases were not related to species' temperature preferences and were detected for habitat generalists as well as herbivorous and omnivorous species, but not for forest specialists and insectivores. Main conclusions Our results suggest subtle effects of climate change on bird abundances which would not have been detectable if we had examined elevational range shifts or changes in species richness. Both warm-and cold-adapted species appear to have benefited from increases in minimum temperatures at high elevations. This was not the case for forest specialists and insectivores which remained stable between sampling periods. This demonstrates that different groups of birds vary in their response to ongoing climatic changes.

Bichet, Orphe; Dupuch, Angelique; Hebert, Christian; Le Borgne, Helene; Fortin, Daniel				Ecological Applications	26	2		612-623	Mar 2016	2016							With the intensification of human activities, preserving animal populations is a contemporary challenge of critical importance. In this context, the umbrella species concept is appealing because preserving a single species should result in the protection of multiple co-occurring species. Practitioners, though, face the task of having to find suitable umbrellas to develop single-species management guidelines. In North America, boreal forests must be managed to facilitate the recovery of the threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Yet, the effect of caribou conservation on co-occurring animal species remains poorly documented. We tested if boreal caribou can constitute an effective umbrella for boreal fauna. Birds, small mammals, and insects were sampled along gradients of post-harvest and post-fire forest succession. Predictive models of occupancy were developed from the responses of 95 species to characteristics of forest stands and their surroundings. We then assessed the similarity of species occupancy expected between simulated harvested landscapes and a 90 000-km2 uncut landscape. Managed landscapes were simulated based on three levels of disturbance, two timber-harvest rotation cycles, and dispersed or aggregated cut-blocks. We found that management guidelines that were more likely to maintain caribou populations should also better preserve animal assemblages. Relative to fragmentation or harvest cycle, we detected a stronger effect of habitat loss on species assemblages. Disturbing 22%, 35%, and 45% of the landscape should result, respectively, in 80%, 60%, and 40% probability for caribou populations to be sustainable; in turn, this should result in regional species assemblages with Jaccard similarity indices of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively, relative to the uncut landscape. Our study thus demonstrates the value of single-species management for animal conservation. Our quantitative approach allows for the evaluation of management guidelines prior to implementation, thereby providing a tool for establishing suitable compromises between economic and environmental sustainability of human activities.

Teng, Mingjun; Zhou, Zhixiang; Wang, Pengcheng; Xiao, Wenfa; Wu, Changguang; Lord, Elizabeth				Environmental Management	57	3		601-619	Mar 2016	2016							Forest network development in urban areas faces the challenge from forest fragmentation, human-induced disturbances, and scarce land resources. Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities. The framework can also be applied to other areas after a sensitivity test of the model and the modification of the parameters to fit the local environment.

Kelt, Douglas A.; Cofre, Hernan; Cornelius, Cintia; Engilis, Andrew, Jr; Gutierrez, Julio R.; Marquet, Pablo A.; Medel, Rodrigo; Meserve, Peter L.; Quirici, Veronica; Samaniego, Horacio; Vasquez, Rodrigo A.				Journal of Arid Environments	126			23-36	Mar 2016	2016							The avifauna of Chile is relatively depauperate, comprising 469 extant species, of which 213 are terrestrial. However, the Coquimbo Region presents a broad ecological transition from the hyperarid Atacama Desert to the north, and the more mesic Chilean Mediterranean region of central Chile, resulting in relatively high species diversity. Approximately 130 species are found here, 8 of which are endemic to Chile although not to this region. Bosque Fray Jorge National Park is a 9959 ha Biosphere Reserve dominated by matorral habitat and hosting up to 123 bird species. Through avian surveys and banding over nearly a decade we have documented 63 terrestrial species and discerned predictable seasonal and interannual structure to avian assemblages, at least through an extended dry period. Recent studies in the matorral habitats of the park indicate seasonal patterns that fall into 4 patterns: year-round residents, winter visitors, summer breeders, and transients. Short-term banding studies demonstrate cooccurring wintering and breeding cohorts among species of Sierra-finches (Phrygilus) in the park; such assemblages and dynamics are reminiscent of North American Mediterranean avian assemblages and pose interesting ecological comparisons. In this period of surveys there appears to have been a gradual transition of the avifauna that may be a response to anthropogenic influence and/or climate change. Research on the foraging behavior of 2 insectivorous species indicate that one of these is convergent on better-known North American taxa while the other clearly is not; these efforts suggest useful avenues for further comparative research. A remarkable coevolutionary association between the Chilean Mockingbird (Mimus thence) and endoparasitic mistletoes (Tristerix) provides insight into potential convergent ecologies in desert regions with different evolutionary histories. Less than 1% of the park comprises temperate forest remnants that subsist due to extensive water input from fog. Research in these remnants has emphasized the role of habitat fragmentation on avian assemblage composition and on reproductive ecology by forest-dependent species. The avifauna here comprises a subset of that found in intact Valdivian rainforest to the south, and forest remnant size alone explains over 90% of the variation in species numbers. One species has been particularly well studied; the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda) is more abundant and has higher nestling survival in larger fragments. We summarize other work on stress responses and variation in song structure in this species. Finally, the role of birds in tree recruitment here has important implications in the face of a recent history of reduction in sizes of forest remnants; numerous birds consume the fruit of the dominant tree, olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum), but they fail to promote successful recruitment because they defecate viable seeds in locations that provide poor survival of seedlings. Ornithological research in Chile is undergoing a modest renaissance, and while dryland avifaunas are characterized more by what is not known and has yet to be studied than by actual ecological understanding, they provide a baseline for many exciting studies ranging from natural history to the role of migration to comparative dynamics of independent lineages in North and South America.

Powell, Luke L.; Wolfe, Jared D.; Johnson, Erik I.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Biological Conservation	194			22-30	Feb 2016	2016							Understanding how animals move in a complex habitat mosaic is critical to biodiversity conservation as deforested lands and secondary rainforests accumulate in landscapes previously dominated by primary forests. To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary forest recovery after pasture abandonment, we formed a conceptual model predicting avian space use during a temporal sequence beginning with deforestation and continuing through regrowth of old secondary forest. We tested five predictions of the model at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil, using 73 radio-tagged understory insectivores of three species: two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, Xiphorhynchus pardalotus) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma). Both woodcreepers provided evidence to support all predictions except that of greater path tortuosity in primary forest. Woodcreepers using secondary forest had larger home ranges, larger core areas, and faster movement rates than in primary forest Further, the proportion of all species' core areas in primary forest exceeded the proportion of home ranges in primary forest. Formicarius colma showed a fundamentally different pattern than the woodcreepers: it essentially avoided secondary forest until 27-31 years after pasture abandonment, at which point movements were indistinguishable from those in primary forest. Formicarius colma and other terrestrial insectivores show implastic spatiotemporal responses to recovering secondary growth, which we suspect contributes to the sensitivity of this guild to forest disturbance. Quantifying the value of marginal (and economically inconsequential) habitats such as secondary forest will be essential as land managers strive to maintain species persistence and connectivity in increasingly heterogeneous tropical landscapes.

Milligan, Megan C.; Johnson, Matthew D.; Garfinkel, Megan; Smith, Chris J.; Njoroge, Peter				Biological Conservation	194			58-65	Feb 2016	2016							Ecosystem services, such as pest control and pollination, are critical benefits of biodiversity important for agricultural production. Predators, including insectivorous birds and ants, can provide important biological controls in agroecosystems, boosting crop yield and offsetting the need for expensive inputs such as pesticides. Local habitat and landscape characteristics can affect the delivery of ecosystem services, thereby influencing optimal land allocation for crop production and biodiversity. In order to better understand the relationship between ecosystem services and the surrounding habitat, we conducted a sentinel pest experiment to investigate predation levels in response to a novel pest on coffee farms in central Kenya. The frequency of predation decreased significantly with increasing distance from adjacent forest fragments and was correlated with bird species richness. Predation was also significantly higher on shade compared to sun coffee farms. We conclude that a land sharing approach, via both the integration of shade trees and the conservation of small forest fragments within or adjacent to a farm, can support increased levels of pest control services provided by birds and ants in Kenyan coffee farms.

Kaminski, Nicholas; Angelo, Alessandro C.; Nicola, Patricia A.				Iheringia Serie Zoologia	106			1-9	2016	2016							The Mixed Rain Forest (Araucaria Forest) is currently restricted to less than 1% of the original area, occurring in different succession stages and degrees of preservation. This paper presents the influence of the gradient of succession vegetation and the phenomenon of bamboo (Merostachys aff. multiramea) flowering and fruiting on a bird community in an area of Araucaria forest on Santa Catarina. Between 2009 and 2010, 20 monthly samples were performed using the methodology of capturing and marking using mist-nets in three successional stages (initial, intermediate and advanced). During sampling, the fruiting of bamboos began in January 2010, allowing an equivalent sampling before and after the event. A total of 557 individuals belonging to 77 species were captured. The highest relative abundances occurred to Haplospiza unicolor (AR = 20,80%), due to the relationship of this species with bamboos in flowering. The highest relative abundance ocurred for 58,44% of the species, pattern already reported in studies using mist-nets in neotropical forests. The highest diversity was found in the initial stage (H'=3,45), followed by intermediate and advanced sucessional stages. However, the equitability is more pronounced in the intermediate stage. The Jaccard similarity index showed that the initial stage is the most different in their composition avifauna in relation with others. The results also showed that the opening of gaps due to the death of bamboos after flowering has a similar role that occurring with habitat fragmentation, with specific impacts in understory insectivores and understory omnivores.								0073-4721								ZOOREC:ZOOR15209058271					J	ZOOR15209058850		Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata in forests: bark beetles, storm, and fire - evolution through catastrophe?	Grauschnapper Muscicapa striata in Waldern: Borkenkafer, Sturm und Feuer - Evolution mit der Katastrophe?	Gatter, Wulf				Vogelwelt	136	1		53-68	2016	2016							In the course of decades of forest avifauna study, catastrophic storms in spruce forests of southwest Germany have led to surprising discoveries regarding Spotted Flycatchers, suggesting that the species has evolved adaptations to such natural disasters. In central Baden-Wurttemberg, Spotted Flycatchers are sparse, inconspicuous inhabitants of older forests. Severe storms in 1967, and especially in 1990 and 1999, provided the opportunity for a long-term study of the adaptation of this species to such events. The dynamics of unhindered succession caused by infestations of bark beetles (Scolytidae) allowed unexpected insights into the settlement strategy, diet phenology, and nesting and breeding behaviour of the flycatcher. The rise in numbers and/or settlement activity of Spotted Flycatcher triggered by the increase in the beetle population enabled us to study trophic processes in stocks of woodland, insects, and birds. In the absence of human influence, the scenario of these processes, where bark beetles from wind-thrown timber spread to and killed neighboring stands, could be followed for up to 16 years. High flycatcher population densities, as well as a band-like distribution that moved with the advancing infestation front, were found. The bark beetles supplied not only a surplus of food, but also of nest sites (thousands of 'bark-pockets, i.e. fragments caught in branch whorls by the Scolytidae beetles loosening the bark in spruce forests), a situation unknown in conventionally managed forests but probably normal in pristine forests. There were over a hundred dying trees standing in every flycatcher territory with a large number of such nesting possibilities, too many for predators to deal with. So we were able to observe the development by Spotted Flycatchers of flexible settlement and reproduction strategies. Territory occupation mostly in June could be interpreted as late arrival of the flycatchers from Africa or as an adaptation to bark beetle phenology. A third strategy could be that breeding outside the early part of the season, when predators are occupying their territories, allows the flycatchers to exploit the situation by breeding when the spatial and temporal pressures of competition and predation are already declining. The strong differences in biology between the Spotted Flycatcher and two Ficedula species (Pied and Collared Flycatcher) could indicate that the evolution of the species as a niche-nester has been shaped by the frequency of (large-scale) catastrophes occurring in unmanaged forest, especially since its wing morphology gives the species a high degree of mobility. The possibility of a 'pheno- or ecotype' Forest Spotted Flycatcher, adapted via mobility to the spatially and temporally unpredictable catastrophes of pristine forest is discussed and contrasted with urban Spotted Flycatchers.								0042-7993								ZOOREC:ZOOR15209058850					J	ZOOR15205029436		Island vs. countryside biogeography: an examination of how Amazonian birds respond to forest clearing and fragmentation.		Wolfe, Jared D.; Stouffer, Philip C.; Mokross, Karl; Powell, Luke L.; Anciaes, Marina M.				ECOSPHERE	6	12		295	Dec 2015	2015							Avian diversity in fragmented Amazonian landscapes depends on a balance between extinction and colonization in cleared and disturbed areas. Regenerating forest facilitates bird dispersal within degraded Amazonian landscapes and may tip the balance in favor of persistence in habitat patches. Determining the response of Amazonian birds to fragmentation may be hindered because many species use adjacent second growth matrices thereby limiting the applicability of island biogeography to predict species loss; alternatively, a countryside biogeographic framework to evaluate the value of regenerating forest may be more appropriate. Here, we used point-count and capture data to compare Amazonian bird communities among continuous forest, 100 ha forest fragments with adjacent second growth, young and older second growth plots, and 100 ha forested islands bounded by water, to test the applicability of island biogeography on the mainland and to assess the ecological value of a regenerating matrix. Among foraging guilds, understory insectivores and flocking species were nearly absent on true islands. Fragments surrounded by young second growth were species rich, suggesting that a developing matrix may mitigate extinction associated with fragmentation. Our findings reinforce that true islands are often extinction-driven systems with distinct, depauperate communities. In contrast, succession of bird communities in second growth facilitates recolonization of forest fragments, permitting fragments as small as 100 ha to support bird communities similar to continuous forest.

Rueda-Hernandez, Rafael; MacGregor-Fors, Ian; Renton, Katherine				Avian Conservation and Ecology	10	2		2	Dec 2015	2015							Avian communities in cloud forests have high levels of endemism and are at major risk given the accelerated rate of habitat fragmentation. Nevertheless, the response of these communities to changes in fragment size remains poorly understood. We evaluated species richness, bird community density, community composition, and dominance as indicators of the response to fragment size in a fragmented cloud forest landscape in central Veracruz, Mexico. Medium-sized fragments had statistically higher than expected species richness and more even communities, which may be a reflection of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which medium-sized fragments are exploited by both forest and disturbance-associated species. Bird density also reached higher values in medium-sized fragments, which may indicate a carrying capacity in this habitat. However, large cloud forest fragments had a distinct taxonomic and functional composition, attributable to an increased number of understory insectivore species and canopy frugivores. By comparison, omnivorous species associated with human-altered habitats were more abundant in smaller fragments. Hence, although medium-sized cloud forest fragments had higher species richness and high bird density, large forest tracts maintained a distinct avian community composition, particularly of insectivorous and frugivorous species. Furthermore, the underlying response to fragmentation can only be properly addressed when contrasting several community attributes, such as richness, density, composition, and species dominance. Therefore, cloud forest conservation should aim to preserve the remaining large forest fragments to maintain comprehensive avian communities and avoid local extinctions.

Bennett, Joanne M.; Clarke, Rohan H.; Horrocks, Gregory F.B.; Thomson, James R.; Mac Nally, Ralph				Landscape Ecology	30	10		2031-2043	Dec 2015	2015							Climate change may amplify the effects of land-use change, including induced changes in interspecific interactions. To investigate whether an avifauna changed over a period of severe drought, and if changes in avifaunas were related to changes in vegetation characteristics and the irruption of a despotic native species, the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. In the box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia, we resurveyed the avifaunas and remeasured vegetation characteristics in 120 forest transects in 2010-2011 that had previously been measured in 1995-1997. The avifauna changed markedly over the prolonged drought, and changes were more marked in smaller fragments of remnant vegetation in which more pronounced vegetation change had occurred. The noisy miner increased differentially in smaller remnants adding to the declines, especially for small-bodied birds. Long droughts interspersed with short wet periods are projected for the region, so the imposition of climate effects on an already much-modified region has profound implications for the avifauna. The noisy miner has (and continues) to benefit from both land-use and climate change, so future sequences of drought interspersed with short wet periods are likely to lead to further changes in the avifauna as the miner extends its occupancy. Differential reductions in small nectarivores and insectivores will affect ecosystem processes, including the control of defoliating insects, seed dispersal and pollination.

Buainain, Nelson; Gaspar, Michele Leocadio; de Assis, Claydson P.				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	23	4		405-416	Dec 2015	2015							Despite being an important area for endemic species of birds, the Caatinga biome is highly fragmented due to anthropogenic influences and there is a lack of study on many aspects of its birds' biology. In this semiarid environment, rainfall is highly seasonal, with two different and well-defined periods: a long dry season, and a short rainy season. This study aimed to qualify and quantify the diet of Sakesphorus cristatus, an endemic thamnophilid bird of the Caatinga, as well as to determine whether there was temporal variation between two different seasons and between dry seasons of two consecutive years. Surprisingly, this was the first study to have focused on describing and quantifying items found of any bird species' diet in the Caatinga. We analyzed the stomach contents of 72 specimens collected in the municipality of Sao Felix do Coribe, Bahia, Brazil. Data analysis included relative abundance and occurrence, average consumption/sample and alimentary importance index of each food category. Sampling adequacy was assessed using cumulative curves constructed with diversity index and coefficient of variation. In general there is a high predominance of ants and termites, with seasonal shifts in the proportion of each item, and a high contribution of caterpillars during the breeding season. During the dry season, the most predominant prey categories in the diet were Formicidae, Isoptera and Coleoptera (adult, A), while during the rainy season, there was an increase in the proportion of Isoptera, Coleoptera (A) and Lepidoptera (larvae) consumption and a decrease in Formicidae. There was no significant difference between consumption of prey items between the two dry seasons. The overall analysis suggests that S. cristatus feeds mainly on the aforementioned insects and is an opportunistic species, adjusting its diet according to their prey availability.

Brazilian Journal of Biology	75	4	Suppl. 1	S176-S183	Nov 2015	2015							The food habits and niche overlap based on diet composition and prey size of two species of understorey insectivorous birds were investigated in an area of montane rain forest in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. A total of 43 birds were captured: 33 individuals of Conopophaga lineata (Conopophagidae) with 13 recaptures, and 10 individuals of Myiothlypis leucoblephara (Parulidae) with 12 recaptures, from which were obtained respectively 33 and 10 fecal samples. Fragments of 16 groups of arthropods, plus insect eggs, were identified in these samples. Conopophaga lineata predominantly consumed Formicidae (32%) and Isoptera (23.6%). However, the index of alimentary importance (AI) of Isoptera (3.53) was lower than other groups such as Formicidae (AI = 61.88), Coleoptera (AI = 16.17), insect larvae (AI = 6.95) and Araneae (AI = 6.6). Myiothlypis leucoblephara predominantly consumed Formicidae (28.2%) and Coleoptera (24.4%), although Coleoptera and Hymenoptera non-Formicidae had the highest values of AI (38.71 and 22.98 respectively). Differences in the proportions of the types of arthropods consumed by birds were not enough to reveal their separation into feeding niches (overlap = 0.618, p observed <= expected = 0.934), whereas differences in the use of resources was mainly due to the size of the prey (p<0.001), where C lineata, the species with the highest body mass (p<0.001) consumed larger prey. It is plausible that prey size is an axis of niche dimension that allows the coexistence of these species.

Fuller, Susan; Axel, Anne C.; Tucker, David; Gage, Stuart H.				Ecological Indicators	58			207-215	Nov 2015	2015							Soundscape assessment has been proposed as a remote ecological monitoring tool for measuring biodiversity, but few studies have examined how soundscape patterns vary with landscape configuration and condition. The goal of our study was to examine a suite of published acoustic indices to determine whether they provide comparable results relative to varying levels of landscape fragmentation and ecological condition in nineteen forest sites in eastern Australia. Our comparison of six acoustic indices according to time of day revealed that two indices, the acoustic complexity and the bioacoustic index, presented a similar pattern that was linked to avian song intensity, but was not related to landscape and biodiversity attributes. The diversity indices, acoustic entropy and acoustic diversity, and the normalized difference soundscape index revealed high nighttime sound, as well as a dawn and dusk chorus. These indices appear to be sensitive to nocturnal biodiversity which is abundant at night in warm, subtropical environments. We argue that there is need to better understand temporal partitioning of the soundscape by specific taxonomic groups, and this should involve integrated research on amphibians, insects and birds during a 24 h cycle. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy, acoustic evenness and the normalized difference soundscape index. This study has demonstrated that remote soundscape assessment can be implemented as an ecological monitoring tool in fragmented Australian forest landscapes. However, further investigation should be dedicated to refining and/or combining existing acoustic indices and also to determine if these indices are appropriate in other landscapes and for other survey purposes.

Ecology (Washington D C)	96	10		2692-2704	Oct 2015	2015							Competitive interactions among species with similar ecological niches are known to regulate the assembly of biological communities. However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects.

Hundred-twenty species of birds were recorded; November and December 2012 had the highest bird abundance and species richness. Forty-two species were registered in 25% of the samples and 39 species in 25.1% - 50% of the samples. The trophic categories with highest diversity were insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous. The obtained data indicated that the sampling area plays an important role in the conservation of the local avifauna, housing many species with dependence of environments showing low levels of human disturbance.

Gudex-Cross, David; Barraclough, Rosemary K.; Brunton, Dianne H.; Derraik, Jose G.B.				EcoHealth	12	3		432-440	Sep 2015	2015							Forest fragmentation and agricultural development are important anthropogenic landscape alterations affecting the disease dynamics of malarial parasites (Plasmodium spp.), largely through their effects on vector communities. We compared vector abundance and species composition at two forest edge sites abutting pastureland and two forest interior sites in New Zealand, while simultaneously assessing avian malaria prevalence in silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). Twenty-two of 240 (9.2%) individual silvereyes captured across all sites tested positive for avian malaria, and Plasmodium prevalence was nearly identical in edge and interior habitats. A total of 580 mosquito specimens were trapped across all sites. These comprised five different species: the introduced Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus; the native A. antipodeus, C. asteliae and C. pervigilans. The known avian malaria vector C. quinquefasciatus was only recorded in the forest edge (mostly at ground level). In contrast, the probable vector C. pervigilans was abundant and widespread in both edge and interior sites. Although frequently caught in ground traps, more C. pervigilans specimens were captured in the canopy. This study shows that avian malaria prevalence among silvereyes appeared to be unaffected by forest fragmentation, at least at the scale assessed. Introduced mosquito species were almost completely absent from the forest interior, and thus our study provides further circumstantial evidence that native mosquito species (in particular C. pervigilans) play an important role in avian malaria transmission in New Zealand.

Peter, Franziska; Berens, Dana G.; Grieve, Graham R.; Farwig, Nina				Biotropica	47	5		626-635	Sep 2015	2015							Insectivorous birds are known to play a decisive role for the natural control of herbivorous insects. Thus, they enhance the growth, reproduction, and survival of plant individuals and in the long-term benefit plant regeneration. However, particularly in the tropics, forest fragmentation has been suggested to cause a loss of insectivorous birds. Yet, it is unclear whether this hampers the trophic control of herbivorous insects with potential consequences for plants. Therefore, we investigated the effect of increasing forest fragmentation on tritrophic interactions between insectivorous birds, herbivorous insects, and plants in a subtropical forest landscape, South Africa. We monitored the community composition of birds and estimated insectivorous bird abundances along a gradient of forest fragmentation. In the same sites, we installed bird exclosures on a common plant species (Englerophytum natalense) to assess effects of the trophic control of insectivorous birds on herbivorous insects and leaf area loss (LAL). Forest fragmentation strongly shaped the functional composition of bird communities, particularly through a loss of forest-dependent insectivorous birds. Moreover, LAL was higher within bird exclosures than on control branches and increased with increasing forest fragmentation on the control branches. Altogether, forest fragmentation seems to hamper the trophic control of herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds through changes in the community composition. This, in turn, may interfere with tritrophic interactions and ecological processes. Thus, conservation efforts aiming at enhancing the natural control of herbivorous insects should focus on the maintenance of continuous indigenous forests that are well-connected to smaller forest fragments on the landscape scale.								0006-3606								ZOOREC:ZOOR15111079586					J	ZOOR15111077517		DIET COMPOSITION OF NESTLINGS AND ADULTS OF THE THREATENED BOLIVIAN SWALLOW-TAILED COTINGA PHIBALURA FLAVIROSTRIS BOLIVIANA (AVES: PASSERIFORMES: COTINGIDAE) IN BOLIVIA.		del Rosario Avalos, Veronica				Journal of Threatened Taxa	7	10		7649-7654	Aug 26 2015	2015							The qualitative and quantitative composition of the nestling and adult diet of the threatened Swallow-tailed Cotinga Phibalura flavirostris boliviana was studied through the analysis of fecal samples. Nestling diet consisted of 62% fruit and 38% insects but varied according to the nestling age. The diet of adults was made up of 89% fruit and 11% insects. The fruit eaten came primarily from the trees Schefflera morototoni, Hyeronima moritziana and Ocotea cuprea. Most insects in the fecal samples were winged-species of the orders Hymenoptera and Coleoptera. This species relied mostly on fruiting trees from semi-humid forest fragments and isolated trees on mountain savannas. Thus, management plans for this bird should consider the conservation of these habitats.								0974-7893; 0974-7907								ZOOREC:ZOOR15111077517					J	ZOOR15111074291		Ecology and conservation of avian insectivores of the rainforest understory: A pantropical perspective.					Powell, Luke L.; Cordeiro, Norbert J.; Stratford, Jeffrey A.	Biological Conservation	188			1-125	Aug 2015	2015							Avian insectivores of the tropical rainforest understory ("understory insectivores") are common, diverse, and often sensitive to disturbance of tropical forest, making them useful as sentinels of rainforest ecosystem change. At the 2013 joint American Ornithologists' Union and Cooper Ornithological Society meeting in Chicago, USA, researchers convened a symposium to address the ecology and conservation of understory insectivores. This Special Issue of Biological Conservation is the result of that symposium: a collection of articles that unites our efforts to further understand and conserve understory insectivores. In this introductory paper, we review the diversity and ecology of understory insectivores, identify threats to the guild, discuss hypotheses on drivers of population declines, and make suggestions for future research. Deforestation and forest degradation are the immediate threats to this guild, with agricultural expansion (particularly oil palm plantations), urbanization, road expansion and logging leading the list. Although vulnerabilities of this guild are most evident in the Neotropics, there are few studies from Asia and fewer still from Africa we recommend increased geographic coverage. If we are to understand the vulnerabilities of understory insectivores from a pantropical perspective, researchers should prioritize understanding the most serious threats (e.g., edge effects, deforestation, fragmentation, etc.) and standardize efforts to gauge understory insectivores' response to these threats (e.g., via species richness, abundance, demographic metrics). A coordinated approach by researchers working in tropical rainforests across the globe can help us understand the ecology of understory insectivores and meaningfully apply conservation and management actions.

Boyle, W. Alice; Sigel, Bryan J.				Biological Conservation	188			11-21	Aug 2015	2015							Tropical forest fragmentation influences community composition via differential species-level effects. Avian responses to fragmentation at La Selva Biological Station are, in part, responsible for the particular concern over the fate of understory insectivorous species. However, since the 1990s, much previously deforested land within and surrounding La Selva has reverted to forest, providing an opportunity to test hypotheses explaining ongoing avifaunal change. Analyses of 23 years (1989-2011) of Christmas Bird Counts reveal that 63 of 202 species have increased whereas 44 are declining, with declines occurring more rapidly than increases. Habitat association was an important predictor of population trends, as understory birds continue to decline whereas forest generalists increased. Our results differ from previous work in the tropics by revealing that, at La Selva, insectivores are not currently suffering greater declines than birds of other dietary guilds. Instead, body size was more strongly associated with population change than was diet, with smaller birds having more negative population trends than larger birds. These results suggest that we must consider additional hypotheses that may explain ongoing population declines of tropical birds. In particular, the associations between population trends and body size implicate physiological mechanisms influencing population change, which may result from direct or indirect consequences of changing climates.

Visco, Deborah M.; Sherry, Thomas W.				Biological Conservation	188			22-31	Aug 2015	2015							Understory insectivorous birds often disappear from fragmented tropical rainforest landscapes before mechanisms such as increased rate of nest depredation can be evaluated. Here, we took advantage of chestnut-backed antbird (Myrmeciza exsul), a representative rainforest understory insectivore that persists in fragments (unlike many other understory species), to identify variables influencing nest predation rate and to test the hypothesis that nest predation underlies avian extirpation in tropical fragments. We compared nest predation rates, bird density, and predator identities in three habitats of lowland Caribbean Costa Rica: two fragments, a peninsular reserve (La Selva Biological Station), and unfragmented rainforest. Our results suggest an inversely density-dependent nest predation pattern: In fragments, chestnut-backed antbirds reached their highest density and contrary to predictions experienced their lowest nest predation rates; La Selva on the other hand experienced the lowest density and highest predation rate. Because nest predation decreased with fragmentation, it appears not to explain declines of understory insectivores from forest fragments generally. Nest survival models indicated that habitat best explained nest predation likelihood, whereas edge, annual, and nest age effects were unimportant. Video surveillance documented both bird-eating snake (Pseustes poecilonotus) causing 80% of nest loss overall (37 of 46 nests) and a larger variety of predators in fragments; thus, landscape factors influenced an understory bird's nest predation. Given the large effect on our focal species, Pseustes likely affects other understory nesters, a topic warranting further study. Tropical reserve conservation plans should consider potential impacts of specialized nest predators on vulnerable understory birds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Arcilla, Nicola; Holbech, Lars H.; O'Donnell, Sean				Biological Conservation	188			41-49	Aug 2015	2015							We investigated how legal logging history and recent illegal logging affected forest bird community structure in Ghana. Ghanaian forests belong to West Africa's highly fragmented Upper Guinea rain forests, part of a global priority "biodiversity hotspot" under intense pressure from anthropogenic degradation. Between 1995 and 2010, officially-reported legal logging intensities increased up to [approximately]600%, while illegal logging, which now accounts for 80% of timber extraction in Ghana, has driven logging intensities to [approximately]6 times greater than the maximum sustainable rate. We collected data in 2008-2010 and used a comparable dataset collected in 1993-1995 to assess impacts of recent logging on understory bird communities in large forest fragments (100-524 km2) in southwest Ghana. Forest understory bird species abundance declined by >50% during this period. Species richness also showed declining trends. Whereas analysis based on data collected in 1993-1995 estimated a partial post-logging recovery of the understory bird community at that time, data from 2008-2010 showed no indication of post,logging recovery, likely due to ongoing illegal logging following intensive legal logging operations. Forest generalist species and sallying insectivores declined significantly in logged compared to unlogged forests. These severe declines of Upper Guinea forest understory birds indicate the rapidly deteriorating conservation status of a biodiversity hotspot and could signal collapsing ecosystem processes. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to protect surviving forest fragments from further degradation and avian declines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cordeiro, Norbert J.; Borghesio, Luca; Joho, Martin P.; Monoski, Teodora J.; Mkongewa, Victor J.; Dampf, Corinna J.				Biological Conservation	188			61-71	Aug 2015	2015							The effect of forest fragmentation on mixed-species foraging bird flocks has been poorly evaluated, particularly in African forests. We examined the consequences of forest fragmentation on such flocks in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, by addressing ecological as well as behavioral components. We counted these flocks in five small (<31 ha), isolated fragments and six widely spaced continuous forest sites. Given that flock cohesion and stability might be facilitated via positive interactions of leader or nuclear species, we focused on one putative nuclear species, the square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus ludwigii), and using playback of its vocalisations, we evaluated (i) if its vocalisations attracted flocking birds as expected by a nuclear species, and (ii) if loss of this species in fragments contributed to flock declines. We found that flocks in forest fragments had smaller sizes, reduced species richness, a reduced proportion of understorey specialists, a higher proportion of forest generalists and non-forest species, and were more variable in size and composition compared to flocks observed in continuous forest. Furthermore, flocks in fragments were composed of a higher proportion of omnivores than insectivores. Despite lower absolute abundance in fragments, D. ludwigii was observed in 86% of natural occurring flocks in both fragments and continuous forest, and flocks with D. ludwigii were significantly larger than those without it-especially in the continuous forest. Playback vocalisations of D. ludwigii attracted flocks of similar abundance and species richness in fragments and continuous forest, but a vastly different composition, confirming (i) its nuclear role and (ii) that, in fragments, flock assemblages had a distinct composition, with a high proportion of forest generalists and non-forest species. Loss or diminished abundance of nuclear species due to fragmentation may be an important factor that affects the presence and composition of mixed-species flocks. Given that 67% of flocking species forage in the understorey, and that insectivores were more negatively affected in fragments than omnivores, the implications of our findings are relevant for conservation in tropical forests.

Pavlacky, David C., Jr; Possingham, Hugh P.; Goldizen, Anne W.				Biological Conservation	188			89-99	Aug 2015	2015							The management of rainforest ecosystems for multi-species conservation must assess the impacts of habitat degradation at different spatial scales as well as determine which species are vulnerable to landscape change. Our research objectives were to (1) evaluate the effects of life history traits on the patch occupancy and vulnerability of rainforest birds, (2) determine the relative effects of stand, landscape and patch structure on species richness, and (3) evaluate the relative contributions of deforestation and fragmentation to species richness. We collected presence-absence data for 29 bird species in 46 rainforest patches in South East Queensland, Australia. We used a multi-species occupancy model that accounted for incomplete detection to evaluate hypotheses for occupancy and species richness. Avian occupancy was strongly influenced by life history traits, including population density, foraging behavior, dispersal strategy, clutch size, body mass and diet. Sedentary species with low population sizes, low clutch sizes, large body sizes and insectivorous diets, such as the ground-dwelling Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti) and canopy-dwelling Paradise Riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), were the most vulnerable to landscape change. After accounting for life history, the positive effect of stand basal area was the best predictor of species richness followed by the positive effects of rainforest and dry eucalypt forest in the landscape, with less support for the positive effect of patch size and negative effect of patch isolation. Deforestation was more detrimental to the bird community than rainforest fragmentation. Conservation actions that retain high stand basal area, promote unmodified landscape mosaics and maintain moderate patch sizes near large rainforest tracts are expected to be effective strategies for managing the rainforest bird community. Landscape conservation strategies to minimize habitat loss are expected to be more effective than managing the configuration of rainforest patches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Powell, Luke L.; Wolfe, Jared D.; Johnson, Erik I.; Hines, James E.; Nichols, James D.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Biological Conservation	188			100-108	Aug 2015	2015							Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus spirurus (n = 19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n = 18), and the terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n = 19). Forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest the oldest at our site. Our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30 years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still.

Stratford, Jeffrey A.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Biological Conservation	188			109-115	Aug 2015	2015							Many insectivorous birds of the tropical rainforest understory, particularly terrestrial species, are prone to local extinctions in fragmented forests. We evaluated the hypothesis that vegetation structural changes in rainforest fragments reduce the availability of microhabitats used by terrestrial insectivores. Near Manaus, Brazil, we compared the vegetation in forest fragments to the vegetation in a continuous forest site where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging. Our focal species included those that are extinction prone in fragments (Myrmornis torquata (Wing-banded Antbird), Grallaria varia (Variegated Antbird), Hylopezus macularius (Spotted Antpitta)), a fragmentation-tolerant species (Myrmothera campanisona (Thrush-like Antpitta)), and species that have and intermediate response (Myrmeciza ferruginea (Ferruginous-backed Antbird), Formicarius colma (Rufous-capped Anttrush), Formicarius analis (Black-faced Antthrush), Conopophaga aurita (Chestnut-belted Gnateater), and Corythopis torquata (Ringed Antpipit)). To quantify vegetation, we measured sixteen habitat variables in 8-m radius plots where birds were observed foraging as well as random points in continuous forest and forest fragments of 1-, 10-, and 100-ha. Four principal components were produced from a principal component analysis and we selected a variable (leaf litter depth, plant cover 3-10 m, density of plants 1-2 m, and plant cover >20 m) from each principal component for our fragment vs continuous forest comparisons. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we estimated the probabilities that the density of plants 1-2 m, proportion of plant cover 3-10 m, and leaf litter depth increased with decreasing fragment area and also exceeded the values associated with fragmentation-sensitive species. We also tested the prediction that plant cover >20 m decreased in forest fragments and that those sites became more open than typical sites used by our focal species. Our predictions were strongly supported: decreasing fragment size was correlated with increasing density of tall plants, increasing mid-story vegetation cover, decreased canopy cover, and increasing leaf litter depth. Even if our focal species are able to disperse to small forest fragments, our results suggest that they may not find enough appropriate habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pollock, Henry S.; Cheviron, Zachary A.; Agin, T.J.; Brawn, Jeffrey D.				Biological Conservation	188			116-125	Aug 2015	2015							Local abiotic conditions (microclimates) vary spatially and selection of favorable microclimates within a habitat can influence an animal's energy budgets, behavior, and ultimately, fitness. Insectivorous birds that inhabit the understory of tropical forests may be especially sensitive to environmental variation and may select habitat based on microclimatic (e.g. temperature, humidity, light) conditions. Sensitivity to microclimate could contribute to the population declines of understory insectivores in response to forest fragmentation or degradation, which changes the physical structure of the forest, thereby increasing light intensity and temperature and decreasing humidity. To understand the role of microclimates in the habitat selection of understory insectivores, we characterized the microclimatic associations of nine species of understory insectivores at three sites along a precipitation gradient and across seasons in central Panama. We compared the distributions of microclimates selected by birds with microclimates at randomly chosen points within their home ranges to test for microclimate selectivity. We predicted that: (1) birds would select microclimates that are more humid, cooler, and less bright than random microclimates, (2) selectivity would be greater in hotter, drier habitats and (3) selectivity would be greatest in the dry season. We found no evidence of selectivity for the nine species we sampled on a seasonal or spatial basis. Microclimate variation was minimal in the forest understory at all sites, particularly in the wet season. Understory insectivores did not use microhabitats characterized by high light intensity, and may be sensitive to light, though the mechanism remains unclear. The lack of microclimate variation in the understory of tropical forests may have serious fitness consequences for understory insectivores due to increasing temperatures associated with climate change coupled with a lack of thermal refugia.

Breed, M.F.; Ottewell, K.M.; Gardner, M.G.; Marklund, M.H.K.; Dormontt, E.E.; Lowe, A.J.				Heredity	115	2		108-114	Aug 2015	2015							Most woody plants are animal-pollinated, but the global problem of habitat fragmentation is changing the pollination dynamics. Consequently, the genetic diversity and fitness of the progeny of animal-pollinated woody plants sired in fragmented landscapes tend to decline due to shifts in plant-mating patterns (for example, reduced outcrossing rate, pollen diversity). However, the magnitude of this mating-pattern shift should theoretically be a function of pollinator mobility. We first test this hypothesis by exploring the mating patterns of three ecologically divergent eucalypts sampled across a habitat fragmentation gradient in southern Australia. We demonstrate increased selfing and decreased pollen diversity with increased fragmentation for two small-insect-pollinated eucalypts, but no such relationship for the mobile-bird-pollinated eucalypt. In a meta-analysis, we then show that fragmentation generally does increase selfing rates and decrease pollen diversity, and that more mobile pollinators tended to dampen these mating-pattern shifts. Together, our findings support the premise that variation in pollinator form contributes to the diversity of mating-pattern responses to habitat fragmentation.

Most of the studies investigating the issue of habitat fragmentation in vertebrates are cross-sectional, whereas long-term studies are least available. We surveyed bird communities in 17 forest fragments (FF) and a single continuous forest stands (CF) in central Italy twice, 10 years apart (i.e. in 1996 and in 2006). All community parameters showed a contrasting pattern between 1996 and 2006, i.e. an increase of abundance and diversity measures in CF and a decrease or a stability of the same parameters in FF. Insectivorous and migratory bird species were the most prone to population declines associated with fragmented landscapes. Differences in species turnover between CF and FF were due to a higher extinction rate in the latter forest type. There was substantial population increase between 1996 and 2006, especially in FF, of opportunistic predator species like corvids. This fact may be responsible for the observed dropping in species number, evenness and diversity in FF. Hence, we conclude that, in FF, the bird community is far from being either stabilized or resilient, as it is rapidly evolving into a more simplified assemblage, dominated by generalist species.

Cabralea canjerana is a common tree in the Montane Atlantic forest, and its reproduction is highly dependent on pollinators. In order to contribute with the particular knowledge on this species, we collected data in three fragmented and three continuous forest sites, where the effects of fragmentation on both mutualistic (pollination) and antagonistic (seed predation) interactions were analysed. We determined fruit production and weight of 25 trees per site. The number of seeds and the percentage of predated and aborted seeds were also accessed for seven fruits of 10 trees per site. Pollinator visitation frequencies to flowers were recorded in two forest fragments and in two sites of the continuous forest. Our data showed that plants of C. canjerana produced more fruits (z-value=-8.24; p<0.0001) and seeds per fruit (z-value=-6.58; p=0.002) in the continuous than in the fragmented sites. This was likely due to differences in pollination, because the number of pollinator visits was higher in the continuous forest than in the fragments. Seed abortion (z-value=4.08, p<0.001) and predation (z-value=3.72, p=0.0002), on the other hand, were higher in the fragmented than in the continuous sites. Then, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions were affected by fragmentation, decreasing the reproductive success of the study tree. This study was the first to show a decrease in the reproductive output in forest fragments in an Atlantic forest tree species. This decrease may threaten the population structure and viability of C. canjerana in forest fragments. Epub 2015 June 01.

Jordani, Mainara Xavier; Hasui, Erica; da Silva, Vinicius Xavier				Journal of Forestry Research (Harbin)	26	2		469-477	Jun 2015	2015							In recent decades, the consequences of habitat fragmentation have been of growing concern, because it is particularly important to understand how fragmentation may affect biodiversity, an ecological service. We tested two hypotheses: (1) that natural fragment size in agricultural landscapes indirectly affects the herbivore through effects on natural predator populations; and (2) predator activity into the crop reduces along the distance from the natural fragment edge. From 2008 and 2009, we conducted our study in seven forest remnants and in surrounding coffee plantations (fragments ranged from 6 to 105 ha, mean 49.28 [plus or minus]A 36.60 ha) in Southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Birds were sampled by point counts, and insect predation was evaluated by using an artificial insect model (Koh and Menge 2006). Our results suggest that although there were many potential predators (e.g., wasps, ants, birds, and mammals), birds were the most important taxon unit. The covariance analysis supported the hypothesis that patch size affected the number of larvae predation by overall taxi, but there was no support for a distance effect. These findings suggest that natural enemies' ecological service (mainly from birds) declined with remnant reduction, which has implications not only for human welfare, but also in strengthening the economic justifications for conserving the remaining natural habitats and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

Barnagaud, Jean-Yves; Papaix, Julien; Gimenez, Olivier; Svenning, Jens-Christian				Diversity and Distributions	21	5		511-522	May 2015	2015							AimWe investigated the contribution of parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) to its host population dynamics at a subcontinental scale. We predicted that the growth rate of cowbirds would be most strongly related to the abundance of forest insectivorous hosts and that landscape fragmentation would have opposite effects on the parasite and its hosts. Furthermore, due to the species' sedentarity and low rates of adult dispersal, we expected that cowbird population dynamics would be structured at local, rather than large spatial scales. LocationThe Great Plains, United States. MethodsWe modelled jointly the population dynamics of cowbird and its 58 most common hosts, accounting for effects of landscape fragmentation and cowbird dispersal. We used Bayesian inference to evaluate this model on 76 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), surveyed each year from 2001 to 2011. We then analysed covariations between the demographic dynamics of cowbirds and their hosts in a multivariate ecological trait space. ResultsContrary to most of its hosts, the cowbird had positive growth rates in man-disturbed, fragmented landscapes, which covaried at small spatial scales. The large-scale effects of parasitism were limited, as few host species affected, or were affected by cowbird growth rates. However, significant cowbird-host relationships were structured by ecological traits: cowbird growth rates were most increased by the abundance of ecological generalists, while hosts were affected by cowbird abundance irrespective of their position in the functional space. Main conclusionsCowbirds parasitize opportunistically the hosts occurring in disturbed landscapes. The large-scale effects of nest parasitism therefore depend probably on landscape structure and other environmental factors operating at local scales. We suggest that efforts to counter the local and continental declines of many passerine species should include parasitism among the biotic components of landscape disturbance.

A study in Australian sub-tropical forest, with wider implications.		Pell, Stuart; Jones, Darryl				Biological Conservation	184			300-309	Apr 2015	2015							A major conservation objective of wildlife overpasses is to maintain levels of dispersal between fragmented areas of habitat, thereby allowing gene-flow and sustaining population viability of target species. We documented crossing rates of a range of avian species, of four defined species guilds, over a vegetated 15 m wide wildlife overpass in suburban Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The overpass spanned a 60 m wide major arterial road, and linked two areas of isolated sub-tropical eucalyptus forest. Crossing rates of these species guilds were also determined over the major road, and two other high-traffic roads, 20 and 90 m wide respectively. Species guilds differed markedly in their crossing rates of the overpass, and in their method of crossing. They also differed in their relative ability to cross high-traffic roads of different width. Our results indicate that, although honeyeater and large forest insectivore guilds made extensive use of the wildlife overpass as a foraging resource and as a conduit between forest areas, the conservation value of wildlife overpasses in relation to potential gene-flow lies mainly with the small insectivore species guild, predominantly with forest-dwelling species of lower bodyweight and with flight characteristics not well-suited to sustained direct flight. Differences between species within this guild may be linked to a range of inter-related factors, including flight capacity, habitat use, and evolutionary history. Overpasses specifically for birds have rarely, if ever, been constructed. It would, however, be relatively simple to incorporate narrow, linear strips of appropriate vegetation strata into multi-purpose overpasses to benefit these target species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ferry; Corlett, Richard T.; Goodale, Eben; Harrison, Rhett D.				Diversity and Distributions	21	4		441-450	Apr 2015	2015							AimForest fragmentation is often accompanied by an increase in hunting intensity. Both factors are known drivers of species extirpations, but understanding of their independent effects is poor. Our goal was to partition the effects of hunting and fragmentation on bird species extirpations and to identify bird traits that make species more vulnerable to these two stressors. LocationMenglun, Yunnan, SW China MethodsWe studied the landscape within 10km radius of Menglun town, where forests have become highly fragmented by monoculture rubber plantations. We compiled data on birds recorded between 1954 and 1983 before forest loss and compared it with a checklist prepared between 2011 and 2014. We used countryside and matrix-calibrated species-area models (SAMs) to estimate the observed slope of forest bird extirpations in Menglun and compared it with the slope expected in the absence of hunting. We also investigated six ecological traits to determine those that best explained bird extirpation probability (EP). ResultsWe found that 34% of the bird fauna had been extirpated from the study landscape, and the estimated slopes of countryside and matrix-calibrated SAMs for forest birds were around 1.4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the 0.35 expected without hunting. Bird EP was strongly associated with size, and understorey insectivores that are known to be susceptible to fragmentation were less susceptible to hunting than frugivores. Given evidence of past and present hunting activity in the area, and the lack of support for alternative explanations, we suggest that hunting increased forest bird extirpations by around 1.3- to 1.6-fold. ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of using species-area relationships to separate area effects from the impacts of hunting. Our results suggest that hunting substantially increases species extirpations in tropical fragmented landscapes and conservation interventions that only target deforestation will therefore be inadequate.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feeding habits of culicids potentially involved in the sylvatic transmission of the virus in this region. Methods: Specimens were collected in 24 forested localities at ground level with hand nets and mouth aspirators. Collections were made quarterly between October 2006 and July 2008 during daylight hours. Blood-meal identification was carried out in mosquitoes of the tribes Aedini, Mansoniini and Sabethini. The biotin/avidin sandwich ELISA was employed to determine six source types: bird, bovine, equine, rat, human and monkey. Results: A total of 24,879 females of the three tribes were obtained, 245 (0.98%) of which were engorged. The presence of three different blood sources per engorged female was the predominant situation, and included 35.10% of the total of samples processed. Samples with two or four different sources were represented by 25.31% and 25.71%, of the specimens, respectively, while just 9.39% had only one type and 1.22%, five different sources. Aedes scapularis, Ae. serratus (Group), Psorophora albigenu and Ps. ferox were the most abundant species and accounted for about 95% of the engorged specimens. Of the principal vector species, Haemagogus janthinomys/capricornii was found with bird, bovine and primate blood. These sources were predominant and alternated top ranking as the most frequent source according to the mosquito species and collection site. In general, primate blood was the most prevalent source. Conclusions: The human population of the region visits this ecotone frequently, which indicates the need for the periodical assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever. The frequency of non-human primate blood source in mosquito species that show minor vector importance in yellow fever virus transmission deserves attention. The eclectic feeding habits and some aspects of the interactions between potential vectors and reservoirs of yellow fever may be associated with the habitat fragmentation characteristic of the region. We recommend that further studies on the capacity and vector competence be performed on secondary vectors in extra-Amazonian region.

Bereczki, Krisztina; Hajdu, Katalin; Baldi, Andras				Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae	61	3		289-304	2015	2015							Controlling herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds is one of the most important regulating services in forest ecosystems. The fragmentation of forests and the associated increase of edge effect, however, influences forest bird communities and thereby may have an impact on biological control via the modification of prey-predator interactions. In the present study we aimed to examine how insectivorous bird abundance and their predation on artificial caterpillars were affected by forest edges and vegetation structure in fragmented temperate forests of southwest Hungary. We found an unexpected negative humped-shaped pattern for predation rate as well as for bird abundance, having peaks both at the edge and in the interior (50 m from the edge). We found a positive correlation between bird abundance and predation rate, therefore the important role of birds in insect pest control was supported. Interestingly, the abundance of insectivorous birds had negative relationships to forest structure variables, such as tree basal area and tree species richness. This unexpected pattern may be a result of the context-dependency of edge effects that cannot be fully explained by our study. It highlights the need for more studies to explore the general pattern of edge effect on insect pest control.

Razeng, Emma; Watson, David M.				Journal of Avian Biology	46	1		89-96	Jan 2015	2015							Food availability is emerging as a key determinant of avian occurrence and habitat use in a variety of systems, but insectivores have received less attention than other groups and the potential influence of nutritional quality has rarely been considered. Rather than a uniform food source, arthropods vary greatly in terms of nutritional composition, but does this variation translate into differential consumption? Building on previous work that demonstrated clear preference for some arthropod groups by 13 species of ground-foraging insectivores, we compare the nutritional composition of these arthropod groups with other groups commonly encountered but seldom consumed in the same habitat types. Using samples of arthropods collected from a eucalypt woodland in southern Australia, we found the high frequency prey groups (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and Araneae) consistently contained higher fractions of crude protein and total fat than the low frequency groups (Diptera, Hymenoptera and Odonata). Even more clear-cut differences were noted in terms of micronutrients; high frequency prey containing significantly greater concentrations of seven elements than low frequency prey and significantly greater amounts per individual arthropod for all eleven elements measured. These results indicate that the nutritional quality plays an important role in prey selection in insectivores and suggests that micronutrients may be more important determinants of prey choice than previously recognized. Integrating these findings with previous work suggesting food limitation may constrain distribution patterns of birds in fragmented landscapes, we contend that variation in nutritional quality helps explain observed patterns in insectivore diets and occurrence. In addition to explaining why smaller and more disturbed habitats are unable to support resident insectivore populations, this bottom-up mechanism may underlie the disproportionate sensitivity of insectivores to land-use intensification.

Sanchez, Natalie V.; Vargas-Castro, Luis E.; Avalos, Gerardo; Paniagua, Federico				Journal of Field Ornithology	85	4		347-354	Dec 2014	2014							Some understory insectivorous birds manage to persist in tropical forest fragments despite significant habitat loss and forest fragmentation. Their persistence has been related to arthropod biomass. In addition, forest structure has been used as a proxy to estimate prey availability for understory birds and for calculating prey abundance. We used arthropod biomass and forest structural variables (leaf area index (LAI) and aerial leaf litter biomass) to explain the abundance of White-breasted Wood-Wrens (Henicorhina leucosticta), tropical understory insectivorous birds, in six forests in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. To estimate bird abundance, we performed point counts (100-m radius) in two old-growth forests, two second-growth forests, and two selectively logged forests. Arthropod abundance was the best predictor of wood-wren abundance (wi = 0.75). Wood-wren abundance increased as the number of arthropods increased, and the estimated range of bird abundance obtained from the model varied from 0.51 (0.28 - 0.93 (95%CI)) to 3.70 (1.68 - 5.20 (95%CI)) within sites. LAI was positively correlated to prey abundance (P = 0.01), and explained part of the variation in wood-wren abundance. In forests with high LAI, arthropods have more aerial leaf litter as potential habitat so more potential prey are available for wood-wrens. Forests with a greater abundance of aerial leaf litter arthropods were more likely to sustain higher densities of wood-wrens in a fragmented tropical landscape.

Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias	86	3		1207-1219	Sep 2014	2014							In northeastern Brazil, the reduction of the natural forest cover to a series of small, isolated fragments has had negative consequences for the local avian fauna, in particular, a loss of the more specialized species, while the populations of some generalists have tended to increase. The present study focuses on the composition and trophic groups of a bird community on a farm in the northeastern Brazilian state of Alagoas. Monthly surveys were conducted between November 2008 and October 2009, based on mist-netting and systematic observations. Overall, 112 species were recorded, of which 76 were associated with the two forest fragments surveyed, while all the others were observed exclusively in the surrounding matrix of pasture and orchards. The bird community presented a predominance of insectivorous species, followed by omnivores. However, specialized trunk-creeping and understory insectivores accounted for only around 15% of the species in this feeding category. The reduced diversity of other guilds and species with more specialized diets, and the complete absence of sensitive species such as large parrots and raptors, reflects the severe fragmentation and degradation of the local forests, which has greatly reduced the availability of dietary resources and breeding sites.								0001-3765; 1678-2690								ZOOREC:ZOOR15101001932	25119733				J	ZOOR15109056796		Avifauna composition in a forest remnant along the Chapecozinho river, southern Brazil.

The present study aimed to characterize the bird communityin a riparian forest remnant along the Chapecozinho river, in southern Brazil, between 2006 and 2009. The birds were analyzed for their predominant diet, preferential habitat, frequency of occurrence and relative abundance. One hundred and five species of birds were recorded. The seasons with highest species richness were spring 2007 and winter 2008. The more representative trophic categories were insectivorous (n=44), omnivorous (n=29) and frugivorous (n=10). Most species were classified as forest birds (n=48). The results showed that the forest remnant may be suffering fromanthropogenic pressures because: (1) seasonal patterns were not verified; (2) generalists and species from open areas were more dominant, such as Guira guia (RA=2,81%), Pyrrhura frontalis (RA=2,66%) and Theristicus caudatus (RA=2,51%). The significant number of omnivores in the area of study corroborates other studies in the region, suggesting that the area suffered environmental changes.			; Favretto, Mario Arthur/G-3534-2019	Guzzi, Anderson/0000-0001-7206-7683; Favretto, Mario Arthur/0000-0001-8582-7493				1809-9939								ZOOREC:ZOOR15109056796					J	ZOOR15012071888		Optimizing carbon storage and biodiversity protection in tropical agricultural landscapes.		Gilroy, James J.; Woodcock, Paul; Edwards, Felicity A.; Wheeler, Charlotte; Medina Uribe, Claudia A.; Haugaasen, Torbjorn; Edwards, David P.				Global Change Biology	20	7		2162-2172	Jul 2014	2014							With the rapidly expanding ecological footprint of agriculture, the design of farmed landscapes will play an increasingly important role for both carbon storage and biodiversity protection. Carbon and biodiversity can be enhanced by integrating natural habitats into agricultural lands, but a key question is whether benefits are maximized by including many small features throughout the landscape ('land-sharing' agriculture) or a few large contiguous blocks alongside intensive farmland ('land-sparing' agriculture). In this study, we are the first to integrate carbon storage alongside multi-taxa biodiversity assessments to compare land-sparing and land-sharing frameworks. We do so by sampling carbon stocks and biodiversity (birds and dung beetles) in landscapes containing agriculture and forest within the Colombian Choco-Andes, a zone of high global conservation priority. We show that woodland fragments embedded within a matrix of cattle pasture hold less carbon per unit area than contiguous primary or advanced secondary forests (>15 years). Farmland sites also support less diverse bird and dung beetle communities than contiguous forests, even when farmland retains high levels of woodland habitat cover. Landscape simulations based on these data suggest that land-sparing strategies would be more beneficial for both carbon storage and biodiversity than land-sharing strategies across a range of production levels. Biodiversity benefits of land-sparing are predicted to be similar whether spared lands protect primary or advanced secondary forests, owing to the close similarity of bird and dung beetle communities between the two forest classes. Land-sparing schemes that encourage the protection and regeneration of natural forest blocks thus provide a synergy between carbon and biodiversity conservation, and represent a promising strategy for reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on tropical ecosystems. However, further studies examining a wider range of ecosystem services will be necessary to fully understand the links between land-allocation strategies and long-term ecosystem service provision.

Fujita, Motoko S.; Prawiradilaga, Dewi M.; Yoshimura, Tsuyoshi				Ecological Research	29	4		741-755	Jul 2014	2014							Industrial timber plantations severely impact biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Forest fragments survive within plantations, but their conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia plantations and fragmented forests in South Sumatra to evaluate each habitat's potential conservation value. To clarify the impact of habitat change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4-year-old acacia plantation (AP4), and 1-year-old acacia plantation (AP1). Estimated species richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP4 and BLF, while AP1 and RLF had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly divided into two groups by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although fragmented forests in our study site lacked several common tropical forest species, these fragments provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly fragmented forests in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in the surrounding landscape.								0912-3814								ZOOREC:ZOOR15011065824					J	ZOOR15101000894		Domestic cat predation on Neotropical species in an insular Atlantic Forest remnant in southeastern Brazil.		Ferreira, Giovanne Ambrosio; Nakano-Oliveira, Eduardo; Genaro, Gelson				Wildlife Biology	20	3		167-175	Jun 2014	2014							The domestic cat Felis silvestris catus is considered a potential threat to the native fauna of regions it populates, particularly when it has free access to these areas. Although this problem is known in Brazil, little is known regarding the effects of this species on natural areas. This study aimed to obtain information concerning the diet of domestic cats by identifying the main items found in fecal samples from domestic cats. In addition, the effects of seasonality on the diet were examined, as it has been hypothesized that seasonal variation of food items has little influence of the diet of the domestic cat. These semi-domiciled cats are thought to face a constant and continuous supply food offered by their owners throughout the year. Feces were collected in a remnant fragment of an Atlantic Forest located south of the municipality of Ilha Comprida - SP, Brazil. These samples provided important information regarding the dietary ecology and predation behavior of this species in endangered forest areas. The results of the scat content analyses demonstrated that domestic cats inserted in this biome presented a generalist and opportunist diet with little seasonal variation, even when receiving food from their owners. The most frequently consumed groups of prey were insects (20.8%) followed by mammals (13.9%) and birds (4.0%). Although the cat is not the only factor that impacts the species of the region, management programs need to be established in conjunction with the local community with the aim of minimizing the pressure exerted by these animals on the native fauna.

Sam, Katerina; Koane, Bonny; Jeppy, Samuel; Novotny, Vojtech				Journal of Field Ornithology	85	2		152-167	Jun 2014	2014							Tropical forests worldwide are being fragmented at a rapid rate, causing a tremendous loss of biodiversity. Determining the impacts of forest disturbance and fragmentation on tropical biotas is therefore a central goal of conservation biology. We focused on bird communities in the interior (>100 m from forest edge) of forest fragments (300, 600, and 1200 ha) in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and compared them with those in continuous forest. We surveyed bird communities using point counts, mist-netting, and random walks, and measured habitat and microclimate characteristics at each site. We also surveyed leaf-dwelling arthropods, butterflies, and ants, and obtained diet samples from birds to examine food availability and food preferences. We recorded significantly fewer bird species per point in the 300-ha forest fragment than in other study sites. Overall, we recorded 80, 84, and 88 species, respectively, in forest fragments, and 102 in continuous forest. Frugivores (especially large frugivores) and insectivores had lower species richness in forest fragments than continuous forest. Our results did not support the food scarcity hypothesis, that is, the decline of insectivorous birds in forest fragments is caused by an impoverished invertebrate prey base. We also found no significant differences among forest fragments and continuous forest in microclimates of forest interiors. Rather, we found that microhabitats preferred by sensitive birds (i.e., 30% of species with the strongest preferences for continuous forest) were less common in forest fragments (19%-31% of points) than in continuous forest (86% of points). Our results suggest that changes in microhabitats may make forest fragments unsuitable for sensitive species. However, limited dispersal capabilities could also make some species of birds less likely to disperse and occupy fragments. In addition, impoverished food resources, size of the forest fragment, or hunting pressure could contribute to the absence of large frugivorous birds in forest fragments. The forest fragments in our study, preserved as village-based protected areas, were not large enough to sustain the bird communities found in continuous forest. However, because these fragments still contained numerous bird species, preservation of such areas can be an important component of management strategies to conserve rainforests and birds in Papua New Guinea.

Railsback, Steven F.; Johnson, Matthew D.				Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	111	16		6109-6114	Apr 22 2014	2014							Global increases in both agriculture and biodiversity awareness raise a key question: Should cropland and biodiversity habitat be separated, or integrated in mixed land uses? Ecosystem services by wildlife make this question more complex. For example, birds benefit agriculture by preying on pest insects, but other habitat is needed to maintain the birds. Resulting land use questions include what areas and arrangements of habitat support sufficient birds to control pests, whether this pest control offsets the reduced cropland, and the comparative benefits of "land sharing" (i.e., mixed cropland and habitat) vs. "land sparing" (i.e., separate areas of intensive agriculture and habitat). Such questions are difficult to answer using field studies alone, so we use a simulation model of Jamaican coffee farms, where songbirds suppress the coffee berry borer (CBB). Simulated birds select habitat and prey in five habitat types: intact forest, trees (including forest fragments), shade coffee, sun coffee, and unsuitable habitat. The trees habitat type appears to be especially important, providing efficient foraging and roosting sites near coffee plots. Small areas of trees (but not forest alone) could support a sufficient number of birds to suppress CBB in sun coffee; the degree to which trees are dispersed within coffee had little effect. In simulations without trees, shade coffee supported sufficient birds to offset its lower yield. High areas of both trees and shade coffee reduced pest control because CBB was less often profitable prey. Because of the pest control service provided by birds, land sharing was predicted to be more beneficial than land sparing in this system.

Otieno, Nickson Erick; Sajita, Nixon; Shitandayi, Dennis				International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation	6	3		290-300	Mar 2014	2014							This study examined the interplay between anthropogenic habitat degradation, forest protection level and density of Turner's Eremomela (TE) (Eremomela tumeri), a globally endangered bird in Kenya's Kakamega forest. Sampling was conducted from May-June 2012 in two contiguous and one isolated forest blocks. Logging intensity, canopy height and cover, plant species richness and other key anthropogenic disturbance were used to characterize habitat quality. Density, encounter rates and TE spatial occurrence were determined using distance sampling. Combined TE density was 0.43 SE 0.09 ha-1 (N = 7, p = 0.03) and was higher in the most protected north block. Estimated overall population in closed canopy forest was 4,282 (Cl = 3,417 to 5,147). High canopy cover boosted TE density (R2 = 0.786, N = 7). Logging intensity was the key driver of forest disturbance (R = 0.742; p = 0.052) leading to reduced canopy cover (R = -0.658, p = 0.050) and reduced plant species richness (R = 0.771, p = 0.042). However, TE presence in the Kisere fragment suggests resilience to some level of isolation or forest disturbance provided sizeable near-primary forest is maintained. An effective medium term conservation strategy should include stricter forest protection and reforesting logged areas to reduce the impact of logging.

Assembly of birds in Rucamanque, Region de la Araucania, was described by acoustic surveys and direct observation. Diversity and guild conformation were compared in native forest and surrounding environments, agroecosystems and plantations. A greater diversity of birds was observed in native forest, followed by agroecosystems and plantations. Also, in the native forest dominated the insectivore guild, while in plantations and agroecosystems omnivores and granivores were the most represented. While in both cases differences were not significant, I discuss about elements associated with habitat, such as landscape and seasonal fluctuation of resources that may affect the spatial pattern of species recorded.								0717-4918; 0718-445X								ZOOREC:ZOOR15111071626					J	ZOOR15109056965		FOREST REMNANTS ENHANCE WILD POLLINATOR VISITS TO CASHEW FLOWERS AND MITIGATE POLLINATION DEFICIT IN NE BRAZIL.

Journal of Pollination Ecology	12			22-30	2014	2014							Pollination deficit could cause low yields in cashew (Anacardium occidentale) and it is possible that deforestation surrounding cashew plantations may prevent effective pollinators from visiting cashew flowers and contribute to this deficit. In the present work, we investigated the proximity effect of small and large forest fragments on the abundance and flower visits by feral Apis mellifera and wild native pollinators to cashew flowers and their interactions with yield in cashew plantations. Cashew nut yield was highest when plantations bordered a small forest fragment and were close to the large forest fragment. Yield from plantations that did not border small forest fragments but were close to the large forest fragment did not differ to yield from plantations at a greater distance to the large forest fragment. Flower visits by wild native pollinators, mainly Trigona spinipes, were negatively affected by distance to the large forest remnant and their numbers were directly correlated to nut yield. The number of A. mellifera visiting cashew flowers did not change significantly with distance to forest fragments, nor was it correlated with yield. We conclude that increasing the number of wild pollinator visits may increase yield, and proximity to large forest fragments arc important for this.

Losada-Prado, Sergio; Finegan, Bryan; DeClerck, Fabrice; Casanoves, Fernando; Dunning, John				Ornitologia Neotropical	25	1		1-11	2014	2014							Understory insectivorous birds are sensitive to fragmentation due to their limited dispersal abilities. This limited dispersal makes these species an important group for conserving the landscape connectivity. Through telemetry methods, banding individuals, capture-recapture techniques, and visual observations, we evaluated Chestnut-backed Antbird individuals (Myrmeciza exsul, a common non-migratory understory insectivorous and forest specialist with low mobility), to determine the home-range size in two fragmented landscapes in southwestern Costa Rica. Additionally, we recorded vegetation data in each one detected home area. We found significant differences (t = -3.52, P = 0.002) between landscapes regarding home-range sizes (1.02-2.76 ha at Los Cusingos Landscape (LCL, N = 19) and 0.77-1.80 at Boruca Landscape (BOL, N = 19)). Additionally, average core areas were estimated between 0.14 and 1.08 ha at LCL and between 0.05 and 0.52 ha at BOL. We concluded that Chesnut-backed Antbird home-range size was influenced by vegetation variables such as basal area and tree density, whereas core area was affected by landscape type.

Invertebrates were the most frequently consumed food items (96.5%) followed by fruits of pioneer species (29.8%) and flowers (6%). We also observed the presence of fragments of bird vertebrae and downs in samples from 2 adult males, this being the first record of predation on small vertebrates by G. agilis. The presence of fragments of birds in the feces of the gracile mouse opossum suggests that despite the small size of this species and its primarily insectivorous habits, small vertebrates may be included in its diet.

Ellis, Murray V.; Taylor, Jennifer E.				Australian Zoologist	37	1		29-39	2014	2014							Loss and fragmentation of the native vegetation of the Central Western Plains of New South Wales was followed by declines of woodland-dependent species. Drought is likely to have further suppressed many animal populations. Here we report on changes in woodland bird reporting rates between surveys in 2005-2009 (drought declared period) and surveys in 2010-2013 following the drought-breaking rains of 2010. By 2013 the number of species detected per survey had just recovered to the level of surveys in 2005/6.The 2013 species composition of the region was similar to that recorded in the 2005-2009 drought surveys, with half of the small insectivorous and nectarivorous woodland birds remaining rare and restricted.Woodland remnants in the landscape continued to be dominated by the same, usually large, species of birds, but reporting rates of 13 of the 15 most common species declined. Conversely, several smaller, foliage gleaning passerines had higher reporting rates post-drought, with Striated Pardalote and Western Gerygone becoming two of the most frequently recorded species. Taxonomic and life history attributes usually did not predict population changes for species post-drought, with the only feeding guild showing a consistent trend being the mistletoe specialists, with only two species. Even after the drought-breaking rains of 2010, there appears to be a reduced vigour in these woodland landscapes.

Deikumah, Justus P.; McAlpine, Clive A.; Maron, Martine				Biological Conservation	169			334-343	Jan 2014	2014							Globally, relatively low-contrast matrices are being converted to high-contrast through increases in land uses such as surface mining. Such conversion affects biodiversity not only at the impact site, but also potentially in adjacent remnant habitat, particularly for habitat types such as tropical rainforest. We investigated how the species richness of different functional groups of tropical rainforest birds varied in remnant rainforest patches embedded in two matrix types (mining vs. agricultural) at two distances to forest edge in fragmented Upper Guinean rainforest landscapes of southwest Ghana. We hypothesized that rainforest adjacent to high-contrast surface mining would support a relatively lower richness of forest-dependent birds than that adjacent to a lower-contrast agricultural matrix. Data from six point counts at each of 32 study sites were used to estimate species richness within ten avian functional groups based on (a) habitat preference (forest specialists, generalists, forest visitors, open country species); and (b) food preference (carnivores, frugivores, omnivores, nectarivores, insectivores and granivores). Species richness of each group was modelled as a function of adjacent matrix type, distance to patch edge and site-level vegetation characteristics using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Forest specialists and frugivores were most strongly negatively affected by adjacent mining, irrespective of distance to forest edge. Forest visitors were more common in forests adjacent to agriculture than mining, and they preferred edges to interior habitats. Forest specialist and frugivore richness also correlated positively with the density of large trees. This effect of a high-contrast matrix on forest birds suggests that even with no additional forest loss, increased surface mining in the Upper Guinea region is likely to result in population declines in forest-dependent birds. Preserving biodiversity in forest landscapes will require management of matrix quality. The widespread trend of increasing patch-matrix contrast from land use change in the matrix is likely to result in negative consequences for biodiversity in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.

Bregman, Tom P.; Sekercioglu, Cagan H.; Tobias, Joseph A.				Biological Conservation	169			372-383	Jan 2014	2014							The fragmentation of forests is a dominant human impact worldwide with major implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although many studies have assessed the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity at local scales, our understanding of the ecological implications for different functional groups of organisms remains limited, particularly at global scales. Here, we use linear mixed models to explore patterns of occurrence and ecological function of 2844 bird species at 293 localities spanning five continents. We show that sensitivity to fragmentation varies according to functional group and body mass, with the prevalence of insectivores and large frugivores declining in relation to fragment size, particularly under 100 ha. However, the most severe effects were restricted to the tropics, whereas fragmentation had no significant impact on the basic ecological structure of temperate bird communities. We conclude that land-use change in tropical systems is likely to disrupt biotic processes, including seed dispersal and the control of insect herbivores. Our findings highlight the importance of latitude in mediating the impacts of habitat loss, and offer general guidelines for the minimum size of fragments required to prevent the collapse of key ecosystem processes in sensitive regions.

Aims We aimed to identify the effect of management type and vegetation features on breeding insectivorous birds and leaf-chewing defoliator insects. Methods In central Portugal, we selected two groups of 20 sites: dense montados (DM, high cover of cork oaks and low cattle impact) and sparse montados (SM, low cover of oaks and high cattle impact). We collected variables associated with vegetation features, bird community and chewing defoliators. Results The two systems differed significantly in oak trunk diameter, oak and shrub cover, tree and shrub diversity. Ground bird densities were higher in SM with fragmented shrub cover. In DM, higher woody vegetation cover and diversity can promote shrub birds and leaf warblers. Oak defoliation was mainly attributed to the sawfly Periclista andrei. Sawfly defoliation was significantly higher in SM and negatively correlated with shrub cover. Conclusions Our results highlight (1) the relevance of management activities conducted at the shrubby layer, (2) the need of an increase in tree diversity and density and (3) the maintenance of a mosaic landscape in order to improve the bird community richness and reduce the defoliation impact in montado system.

Calvino-Cancela, Maria				Forest Ecology and Management	310			692-699	Dec 15 2013	2013							In the fragmented forest landscape of Europe, tree plantations comprise an increasingly important fraction of the matrix surrounding natural forest fragments. Plantations may provide habitat for forest biodiversity, which may enhance landscape connectivity and regional biodiversity. I compared the diversity and composition of bird communities in eucalypt plantations of three ages (young, intermediate and mature) and with low management intensity with respect to pine plantations, native forests and shrublands. Differences in composition of species and species groups were analyzed with PERMANOVA and visually represented using NMDS ordinations. Species groups were established according to diet, habitat and microhabitat preferences, and conservation status. A total of 887 bird encounters and 45 species were recorded. Native forests had the highest species richness per site and per sample, followed by pine plantations and shrublands. Eucalypt plantations had the lowest species richness, and decreasing with age, and the lowest bird abundance. According to composition, two habitat groups could be distinguished: wooded habitats, including native forests and plantations except young eucalypt plantations; and shrubby habitats, with shrublands and young eucalypt plantations. Native forests and pine plantations had the most similar composition among wooded habitats, and were associated with forest specialists, whereas species having unfavorable conservation status were associated with shrublands and young eucalypt plantations. In eucalypt plantations, birds were mainly associated with shrubs at young ages and with canopies at older ages, with flowers as an important food resource. The paucity of birds in eucalypt plantations contrasted with the diverse and abundant avifauna in pine plantations. The alien status and taxonomic isolation of Eucalyptus globulus in the region, together with specific features of its leaves and bark, may explain the low suitability of eucalypt plantations, by limiting the presence of phytophagous insects and thus the availability of prey for birds.

Diversity and Distributions	19	12		1468-1479	Dec 2013	2013							AimReports of profound changes in species assemblages brought about by the influence of strongly interacting species are increasingly common. Where these strong interactors are sensitive to anthropogenic habitat changes, relatively small alterations in the environment can result in large and pervasive shifts in assemblages. We review the evidence for widespread assemblage-level phase shifts across eastern Australia, triggered partly by anthropogenic habitat alteration and mediated by a native, despotic bird: the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. LocationEastern Australia. MethodsBased on the literature, we developed conceptual models of factors affecting site occupancy by, and ecosystem-level effects of, the noisy miner. We also analysed recent trends in the reporting rate of the noisy miner across its range. ResultsIndividuals of this species cooperate to aggressively exclude almost all smaller bird species from the areas they occupy. The noisy miner is advantaged by habitat fragmentation and structural simplificationhabitat changes that facilitate detection and interception of potential competitors by miners. We report that the species is increasingly prevalent, particularly close to forest and woodland edges. Such edges have mainly been created by human land use. The evidence we reviewed showed: (1) strong causal links between the noisy miner and depressed richness and abundance of smaller birds, particularly nectarivores and insectivores; (2) moderate evidence of a positive association with larger bird species; (3) reduced tree condition stemming from impaired control of insect herbivore populations by smaller insectivores; and (4) a plausible negative effect on plant reproduction through reduced tree condition, altered pollination services and altered seed dispersal. Main conclusionsThis is the first synthesis to document the causes and likely ecological consequences of increasingly prevalent phase shifts catalysed by a despotic species on ecosystems at very large spatial scales (>1million km2). Native species affected by human activities can become agents that induce ecological dysfunction.

Santiago-Alarcon, Diego; Havelka, Peter; Pineda, Eduardo; Segelbacher, Gernot; Schaefer, H. Martin				Parasitology	140	14		1799-1810	Dec 2013	2013							Culicoides vectors can transmit a diverse array of parasites and are globally distributed. We studied feeding preferences and seasonal variation of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) vectors in an urban forest of Germany to determine whether humans living nearby are readily exposed to vector-borne parasites from wild animals. We used a fragment of the mtDNA COI gene to identify hosts from blood meals. We amplified a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b to detect haemosporidian infections in Culicoides abdomens and thoraxes. We detected a total of 22 Culicoides species. Fifty-eight blood meals (84%) were from humans, 10 from birds, and one from livestock. We found Culicoides kibunensis (considered ornithophilic) with 29 human blood meals. Host generalist Culicoides festivipennis and Culicoides obsoletus had 14 human blood meals. Culicoides clastrieri and Culicoides semimaculatus fed on birds; previously humans were their only known host. Six thoraxes and three abdomens were infected with either Haemoproteus pallidulus or Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi. There were changes in Culicoides community structure across months. Culicoides pictipennis was the dominant species during spring, C. kibunensis and C. clastrieri were dominant during summer, and C. obsoletus was dominant by early autumn. All dominant species were generalists feeding on birds, livestock and humans. Our results indicate that humans can serve as a blood source for dominant Culicoides species instead of the normal wild animal hosts in urban areas.

We studied this in Cotove Agricultural Center in the municipality of Santa Fe de Antioquia (Colombia),where the conversion of natural forests to different land use systems, has limited the amount of available habitat. With the aim to describe the effect of habitat loss on bird presence in five land uses (fruiting trees, silvopastoral systems, secondary forest, pasture low density of trees and grass cutting) in this area, we studied bird diversity using two methods: fixed point counts and mist nets to analyze the influence of land use in the composition, richness and abundance of birds present were studied. A total of 6 633 individuals of 101 species were observed of which 11 species were migratory. The insectivorous and frugivorous foraging guilds were better represented. The Shannon index indicated the highest values of alpha diversity for the silvopastoral system, and the fruit with the lowest. The grazing and silvopastoral land systems shared more species with low tree density. The importance of the environmental heterogeneity found is highlighted as a positive factor for bird species richness, mostly of low and middle habitat specificity, and preferably from edge habitats and open areas. In order to preserve natural regeneration and connectivity between different land use types, and to promote stability of bird species populations, some management actions should be implemented in the area.

Ferreira, Maxmiller Cardoso; Consolaro, Helder				Bioscience Journal	29	5		1708-1720	Nov 2013	2013							The objective was to identify the reproductive phenology and the pollination and dispersal syndromes of understory species of Semi-deciduous Dry Forest. The work was carried out from May 2010 to May 2011 in a forest fragment, about 29 hectares, localized in Catalao city, Goias State, Brazil. The phenological phases were observed weekly along a transect at 1000m. Pollination and dispersion syndromes were determined through literature data, and theses data were linked to phenology. The flowering proportion reached the peak (43,13%) in December 2010 (rainy) and fruiting (30%) in September 2010 (dry). Acanthaceae flowering peak in May 2010 and February 2011; Piperaceae peaked in October 2010 and Rubiaceae in December 2010. Fruiting in the Acanthaceae occurred during the dry period and the beginning of the rainy season, with the highest incidence in October 2010, Piperaceae reached their peak in May 2011, while in the Rubiaceae, it went on for 11 months, with the highest incidence being in March 2011. Two Acanthaceae and one Piperaceae species not fruited, but all species presented flowering. Pollination syndromes found were Ornithophily, peaking in May 2010, Melittophily, in October 2010, and Psycophily, in January 2011. Dispersal syndromes found were Anemochoric, with a higher incidence in October 2010, and Ornithocoric with two peaks, one in July 2010 and other in May 2011. The year-long presence of flowering and/or fruiting species contributes to the survival and dynamics of the community studied, because these species play an important role maintaining bees and birds in the fragment, which are important vectors of pollination and dispersal, respectively. Considering the rapid loss of the Cerrado vegetation in recent times and the study site to be a fragment localized inside the urban environment, the conservation of the green area becomes important, regardless of its small size, due to the important ecological processes that lie therein, as portrayed in this study.

O'Brien, Valerie A.; Reiskind, Michael H.				Journal of Medical Entomology	50	6		1231-1239	Nov 2013	2013							Landscape fragmentation often increases contact between humans, wildlife, and potential disease vectors. We examined how adult host-seeking mosquitoes respond to small-scale habitat differences within southern Great Plains cross-timber habitat mosaics in northern Oklahoma consisting of eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginianus L.) woodlands, mixed-deciduous woodlands, and adjacent grasslands. Mosquitoes responded most markedly to an overall grassland-woodland habitat gradient, with species separating by habitat based largely on tree density. Differences in abundance of host-seeking females occurred at fine spatial scales, sometimes varying dramatically over distances as little as 200 m when tree density changed abruptly. Tree type was not as important as tree density, although the West Nile virus vector Culex tarsalis Coquillett showed a greater affinity for areas containing eastern red cedar than for deciduous woodlands. The invasive Aedes albopictus Skuse showed equal affinity for both tree types. Conversion of grassland habitats in the Great Plains to more vegetated environments associated with humans (towns and homesteads) and the invasion of grasslands by eastern red cedar may change the species composition of mosquito, bird, and mammal assemblages and potentially alter arbovirus exposure for humans.

Felix, Saulo; Morim Novaes, Roberto Leonan; Souza, Renan de Franca; Santori, Ricardo Tadeu				Mammalia	77	4		451-454	Nov 2013	2013							The greater round-eared bat Tonatia bidens has a varied diet, consuming mostly insects, although it also feeds on small terrestrial vertebrates, such as rodents and birds. In 2008-2009, we expanded the knowledge of this species' feeding ecology by analyzing the diet of a T. bidens population in an Atlantic Forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. Food remains found in day shelters and feeding roosts included insects, birds, mammals and fruits. Insects, Lepidoptera, Blattodea, Coleoptera and Orthoptera, were the main component of the diet. There was a preferential consumption of the soft parts of insects and vertebrates, possibly because these parts are more easily digested and are the most nutritious. This first evidence of fruit consumption is also discussed. This analysis indicates that T. bidens has a more general diet than previously reported.			de Franca Souza, Renan/C-7122-2018	de Franca Souza, Renan/0000-0002-3181-8353; Novaes, Roberto Leonan/0000-0003-1657-2807				0025-1461								ZOOREC:ZOOR15003011883					J	ZOOR15207042029		Within-territory use of different land cover types by tropical forest birds in a fragmented landscape.		Withey, John C.				Biological Conservation	167			405-413	Nov 2013	2013							Many terrestrial species of birds have been observed to depend on large contiguous areas of forest; in the tropics this appears to be especially true for terrestrial insectivores. Far less is understood about how more-common species, that are less dependent on interior forests, use both forested and non-forested habitat in fragmented landscapes. Using both behavioral observations and radio-tracking relocation data, I quantified the within-territory use of different land cover types for three tropical songbird species, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina), red-throated ant-tanager (Habia fuscicauda), and cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans). Small forest fragments (<50 ha) were also surveyed for these same species. Territories of all three species were mostly forest (>75%), with different amounts of non-forested land cover. As predicted, all three species had increased use in forest cover and decreased use where neighboring territories overlapped. In addition all three species had higher use of areas where there were more forest gaps and/or 'soft edges' in the vicinity. Dusky antbirds were less likely to use monocultures of non-native grass and impervious surfaces, while the other two species had mixed responses to non-forested habitats. Dusky antbirds and cocoa woodcreepers were observed foraging at higher-than-expected frequencies along 'hard edges' of forested habitat. All three species were found in forest fragments even smaller than a minimal home range area estimate. Conservation of more-common bird species in fragmented landscapes can include secondary forests and small remnants but for these three species non-forested land cover alone would not be expected to provide breeding habitat.

Teixeira, Fagner Daniel; Cascelli de Azevedo, Fernando Cesar				Biota Neotropica	13	4		391-394	Oct 2013	2013							Honeydew foraging by birds has been extensively documented in recent years. However, this interaction has been poorly documented in Brazil, with predominance of few species of birds foraging only in Mimosa scabrella trees. With the objective of describing the behavior of birds interacting with scale insects associated with trees, we conducted a study at the Serra de Sao Jose, Tiradentes, in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Observations were recorded from June to July 2012. We observed 13 species of birds feeding on honeydew scale insects, eight never previously recorded. We observed individuals using aerial and surface maneuvers to collect the honeydew on the branches or reaching the droppings below the branches. These species were observed foraging individually, in pairs and also in large groups. Our results suggest that honeydew excretion from scale insects associated with Pseudopiptadenia leptostachya trees represents an important energy source for local birds as observed in fragments of Atlantic Forest in the Minas Gerais State, southeast region of Brazil.								1806-129X; 1676-0611							10.1590/S1676-06032013000400035	ZOOREC:ZOOR15008039456					J	ZOOR15003009410		Coffee Agroforests Remain Beneficial for Neotropical Bird Community Conservation across Seasons.		Hernandez, Sonia M.; Mattsson, Brady J.; Peters, Valerie E.; Cooper, Robert J.; Carroll, C. Ron				PLoS ONE	8	9		e65101, 1-9	Sep 18 2013	2013							Coffee agroforestry systems and secondary forests have been shown to support similar bird communities but comparing these habitat types are challenged by potential biases due to differences in detectability between habitats. Furthermore, seasonal dynamics may influence bird communities differently in different habitat types and therefore seasonal effects should be considered in comparisons. To address these issues, we incorporated seasonal effects and factors potentially affecting bird detectability into models to compare avian community composition and dynamics between coffee agroforests and secondary forest fragments. In particular, we modeled community composition and community dynamics of bird functional groups based on habitat type (coffee agroforest vs. secondary forest) and season while accounting for variation in capture probability (i.e. detectability). The models we used estimated capture probability to be similar between habitat types for each dietary guild, but omnivores had a lower capture probability than frugivores and insectivores. Although apparent species richness was higher in coffee agroforest than secondary forest, model results indicated that omnivores and insectivores were more common in secondary forest when accounting for heterogeneity in capture probability. Our results largely support the notion that shade-coffee can serve as a surrogate habitat for secondary forest with respect to avian communities. Small coffee agroforests embedded within the typical tropical countryside matrix of secondary forest patches and small-scale agriculture, therefore, may host avian communities that resemble those of surrounding secondary forest, and may serve as viable corridors linking patches of forest within these landscapes. This information is an important step toward effective landscape-scale conservation in Neotropical agricultural landscapes.

Deikumah, Justus P.; McAlpine, Clive A.; Maron, Martine				PLoS ONE	8	9		1-10	Sep 13 2013	2013							Conversion of farmland land-use matrices to surface mining is an increasing threat to the habitat quality of forest remnants and their constituent biota, with consequences for ecosystem functionality. We evaluated the effects of matrix type on bird community composition and the abundance and evenness within avian functional groups in southwest Ghana. We hypothesized that surface mining near remnants may result in a shift in functional composition of avifaunal communities, potentially disrupting ecological processes within tropical forest ecosystems. Matrix intensification and proximity to the remnant edge strongly influenced the abundance of members of several functional guilds. Obligate frugivores, strict terrestrial insectivores, lower and upper strata birds, and insect gleaners were most negatively affected by adjacent mining matrices, suggesting certain ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal may be disrupted by landscape change in this region. Evenness of these functional guilds was also lower in remnants adjacent to surface mining, regardless of the distance from remnant edge, with the exception of strict terrestrial insectivores. These shifts suggest matrix intensification can influence avian functional group composition and related ecosystem-level processes in adjacent forest remnants. The management of matrix habitat quality near and within mine concessions is important for improving efforts to preserveavian biodiversity in landscapes undergoing intensification such as through increased surface mining.								1932-6203								ZOOREC:ZOOR15001001051					J	ZOOR15006029321		Evaluation of natural foci of Panstrongylus megistus in a forest fragment in Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.		dos Santos, Jose Eloy, Jr; Viola, Mariana Gubert; Lorosa, Elias Seixas; de Menezes Machado, Evandro Marques; Ruas, Antonio Leite, neto; Corseuil, Elio				Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical	46	5		575-583	Sep 2013	2013							Introduction: Panstrongylus megistus is commonly found in wild environments of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the network of refuges used by triatomine in a forest fragment of Porto Alegre and to identify Trypanosoma cruzi infection, associated hosts and the epidemiological importance of both hosts and triatomines. Methods: Techniques including the spool-and-line method and active searching (transects) were used to identify natural foci. Results: The food source for each triatomine was determined using the precipitin test, and the infection of marsupials was determined by xenodiagnosis. A total of 33 adults (domestic environment) and 27 nymphs (wild environment) of P rnegistus were found in addition to 43 Didelphis albiventris specimens. The infection rates of triatomine adults, triatomine nymphs and opossums with T cruzi I were 64%, 73% and 69%, respectively. Birds, rodents and opossums were the main resources used by triatomine. Conclusions: This work presents the first characterization of a natural focus of? megistus in Rio Grande do Sul. The natural characteristics of this focus and its implication in the transmission of T cruzi are discussed.								0037-8682								ZOOREC:ZOOR15006029321	24270248				J	ZOOR15003014346		Comparing the Structure and Robustness of Passifloraceae - Floral Visitor and True Pollinator Networks in a Lowland Atlantic Forest.		Benevides, C.R.; Evans, D.M.; Gaglianone, M.C.				Sociobiology	60	3		295-305	Sep 2013	2013							We investigated the plant-pollinator interactions of Passifloraceae occurring in fragments of lowland semi-deciduous Atlantic forest. We described floral biology, pollination syndromes and the pollinators of Passiflora alata, Passiflora kermesina, Passiflora suberosa, Passiflora malacophylla and Mitostemma glaziovii. We examined the robustness of the interaction networks to species loss, a plausible scenario resulting from forest fragmentation. The effects of pollination syndrome (flower size) on network robustness was also examined. Passiflora alata, P. malacophylla and P. suberosa were pollinated by bees of different corporal sizes. P. kermesina and M. glaziovii presented the highest diversity of visitors and were pollinated mainly by hummingbirds and butterflies, respectively. Through the analysis of the networks we differentiate the structures of the flower-visitor network with the 'true' plant-pollinator network. The robustness of the flower-visitor network to animal loss was generally high, but it declined when only true pollinators were included in the network. The sequential loss of plants from the flower-visitor network resulted in low robustness: the loss of key plants could have significant cascading effects on the animals feeding on them within the forest fragment. Future studies should consider the interactions between all flowering plants and animals in this habitat in order to guide conservation and management plans for these forest fragments.

Seven individuals were captured with mist-nets. Regurgitation samples were obtained by administering an antimony-potassium tartrate emetic. Only five birds produced recognizable fragments. The diet consisted of 11 taxonomic categories: 88.33% of which were arthropods and 11.66% plants. Results revealed that Acari are one of the main items ingested, followed by Coleoptera, insect eggs, Orthoptera and unrecognizable vegetable material. C. cinnamomeus showed a moderately high diet diversity (H' = 2.46). The species is predominantly insectivorous, with a niche width of (0.11) leading to the supposition that it does not have a preferential homogeneity for sources in its arthropod diet. Although they are basically neotropical insectivores, vegetable material consumption seems to be a habitual event in species of the Furnariidae family.								0375-538X								ZOOREC:ZOOR15106036892					J	ZOOR14911059095		RECOVERY OF UNDERSTORY BIRD MOVEMENT ACROSS THE INTERFACE OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMAZON RAINFOREST.		Powell, Luke L.; Stouffer, Philip C.; Johnson, Erik I.				Auk	130	3		459-468	Jul 2013	2013							Amazonia now contains vast areas of secondary forest because of widespread regeneration following timber harvests, yet the value of secondary forest to wildlife remains poorly understood. Secondary forest becomes structurally similar to primary forest after abandonment, and therefore we predicted that avian movement across the interface of primary and secondary forest (hereafter "the interface") would gradually increase with time since abandonment until recovery to pre-isolation levels. From 1992 to 2011, we captured 2,773 understory birds of 10 foraging guilds along the interface of primary forest fragments and zero- to 30-year-old secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. Our objectives were to understand the differences in land-use history that affect cross-interface movement and to determine how long it takes each guild to recover to pre-isolation capture rates. Across guilds, age of secondary forest within 100 m of the interface was the most important explanatory variable affecting capture rates; rates increased with age of secondary forest for all guilds except non-forest species. Mean recovery to pre-isolation was 26 years (asymmetric SE = 13 years below and 16 years above estimate) after secondary forest abandonment and 9 of 10 guilds recovered within 13 to 34 years. In the slowest guild to recover, terrestrial insectivores, 6 of 12 species were never caught along the interface, and we projected that this guild would recover in 60 years. Our recovery estimates quantify the dynamic permeability of the interface and contribute to a better understanding of the value of secondary forests as corridors among primary forest fragments.

Winter numerical responses of generalist insectivorous birds to overwintering larvae of a key pine defoliator, the pine processionary moth, has received little attention to date. Here, we tested the effects of forest structure and composition at stand and landscape scales on overwintering moth density and winter bird communities, including generalist moth predators. We assessed moth nest density and bird communities during two consecutive winters on 25 linear transects along an elevation gradient in mountain pine forests of the southern French Prealps. We found that winter severity significantly decreased both moth density and total bird abundance and richness. Pine processionary moth density increased with south-facing aspects and forest fragmentation, especially edge density, at the landscape scale. Winter bird communities were influenced more by forest fragmentation at the landscape scale than stand-scale variables, except moth density. Total bird abundance increased significantly with moth density only in the colder winter. Great tit Parus major abundance also increased significantly with moth density, but irrespective of winter severity. Winter bird numerical responses were mediated primarily by landscape composition, and secondarily by forest stand structure and composition. We suggest that landscape-scale conservation of bird functional diversity in both breeding and wintering seasons would increase opportunities for biological control of pest insects in mountain forests.

Neuschulz, E.L.; Brown, M.; Farwig, N.				Animal Conservation	16	2		170-179	April 2013	2013							Previous studies that tracked the movements of single bird species within human-modified landscapes have shown that the ability of forest birds to move across matrix habitat differs among species. Functional guild specificity as well as landscape characteristics have been shown to influence bird movements, entailing different movement behaviour of birds within a community. Studies investigating how both these factors influence the movements of entire bird assemblages across fragmented landscapes are essential but have rarely been conducted. In this study, we determined how species' traits and different forest matrices influence bird movements among nine forest patches in a highly fragmented South African landscape. We combined 90h of bird observations with capturemarkrecaptures (104754 mist-net hours) to distinguish between movements among patches (all birds that conduct long-distance movements across the landscape) and movements within patches (all resident birds that conduct only short-distance movements within a fragment). Overall, we detected a high bird movement activity across the fragmented landscape. Dietary specialization, habitat affinity and body mass strongly shaped the relative distribution of bird species across the nine fragments with frugivorous birds, forest specialists and large-bodied species showing the highest movement abilities. In contrast, resident insectivores and forest generalists tended to move only within particular forest fragments. Our results suggest that remnant forest fragments may represent valuable stepping stones as well as permanent habitat for local bird assemblages. We emphasize that beside the conservation of natural forests, the maintenance of nearby, structurally rich forest fragments is pivotal in maintaining regional forest bird assemblages in human-modified landscapes.								1367-9430; 1469-1795								ZOOREC:ZOOR14908034689					J	ZOOR14907028319		Structurally complex farms support high avian functional diversity in tropical montane Ethiopia.

We compared the composition of bird feeding guilds in tropical forest fragments with adjacent agro-ecosystems in a montane region of south-west Ethiopia. We used a series of point counts to survey birds in 19 agriculture and 19 forest sites and recorded tree species within each farm across an area of 40 x 35 km. Insectivores ([approximately]17 spp. per plot), frugivores ([approximately]3 spp. per plot) and omnivores ([approximately]5 spp. per plot) maintained species density across habitats, while granivores and nectarivores increased in the agricultural sites by factors of 7 and 3 respectively. Species accumulation curves of each guild were equal or steeper in agriculture, suggesting that agricultural and forest landscapes were equally heterogeneous for all bird guilds. Counter to most published studies, we found no decline in insectivore species richness with forest conversion. However, species composition differed between the two habitats, with certain forest specialists replaced by other species within each feeding guild. We suggest that the lack of difference in insectivorous species numbers between forest and agriculture in this region is due to the benign nature of the agricultural habitat, but also due to a regional species pool which contains many bird species which are adapted to open habitats.								0266-4674								ZOOREC:ZOOR14907028319					J	ZOOR14906024349		Microhabitat associations of terrestrial insectivorous birds in Amazonian rainforest and second-growth forests.		Stratford, Jeffrey A.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Journal of Field Ornithology	84	1		1-12	Mar 2013	2013							Across the Neotropics, small-bodied terrestrial insectivores are sensitive to forest fragmentation and are largely absent from second-growth forests. Despite their sensitivity to forest structure, the microhabitat relationships of these birds have not been quantified. From July 1994 to January 1995 in central Amazonia, we characterized habitat at sites where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging, as well as at randomly selected sites in continuous forest and two types of 1015-yr-old second-growth forest common in Amazonia (Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated). We used factor analysis to find suites of correlated variables. From each factor, we selected a representative variable that was relatively easy to measure. We used Bayesian analysis to estimate means and standard deviations of these variables for each species and for each type of habitat. All nine focal species were associated with ranges of microhabitat variables, such as leaf litter depth and tree densities, often absent in second-growth forests. At least in the early stages of regeneration, neither type of second-growth forest provides suitable structure for the terrestrial insectivores in our study. The large leaves of Cecropia trees that make up the thick leaf litter may preclude the use of Cecropia-dominated second growth by our focal species, many of which manipulate leaves when foraging. The leaf litter in Vismia-dominated second growth was also thicker than sites used for foraging by our focal species. In addition, Vismia-dominated growth had more small trees and small nonwoody vegetation, perhaps impeding movement by terrestrial birds. In continuous forest, our focal species foraged in microhabitats with characteristics that generally overlapped those of randomly selected sites. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that microhabitat differences make second-growth forests unsuitable for our focal species. RESUMEN A lo largo del Neotropico, Aves insectivoras terrestres de tamano corporal pequeno son sensibles a la fragmentacion del bosques y en gran parte estan ausentes en los bosques de crecimiento secundario. A pesar de su sensibilidad a la estructura del bosque, las relaciones de estas Aves con el micro habitat no han sido cuantificadas. Desde julio de 1994 hasta enero de 1995 en la Amazonia central caracterizamos habitats en lugares en donde nueve especies de Aves insectivoros terrestres fueron observadas buscado alimento, al igual que en lugares seleccionados aleatoriamente en un bosque continuo y en dos tipos de bosques secundarios de 10 y 15 anos, comunes en la Amazonia (Vismia-dominado y Cecropia-dominado). Usamos un analisis factorial para encontrar el conjunto de variable que se correlacionaron. Tambien usamos un analisis bayesiano para estimar el promedio y las desviaciones estandar de estas variables para cada especie y cada tipo de habitat. Las nueve especies focales se asociaron con elementos variables del micro habitat, tales como profundidad de la hojarasca y densidad de arboles, usualmente ausentes en bosques de crecimiento secundario. Al menos en los estadios tempranos de regeneracion ninguno de los tipos de crecimiento secundario provee una estructura adecuada para los insectivoros terrestres de nuestro estudio. Las largas hojas de los arboles de Cecropia que crean una hojarasca mas gruesa pueden evitar el uso de bosques de crecimiento secundario dominado Cecropia por parte de nuestras especies focales, muchas de las cuales manipulan hojas cuando estan buscando alimento. La hojarasca de los bosques de crecimiento secundario dominados por Vismia tambien fue mas gruesa respecto a los lugares usados por nuestras especies focales para buscar alimento. Adicionalmente, los bosques dominados por Vismia tuvieron mas arboles pequenos y pequena vegetacion no lenosa, que puede impedir el movimiento de las Aves terrestres. En bosques continuos, nuestras especies focales buscaron alimento en micro habitats con caracteristicas que generalmente se superpusieron con las de los lugares escogidos aleatoriamente. En consecuencia, nuestros resultados son consistentes con la hipotesis que diferencias en micro habitat hacen que los bosques de crecimiento secundario sean lugares inadecuados para nuestras especies focales.

Nsor, Charles; Chapman, Hazel M.				Malimbus	35	1		37-49	Mar 2013	2013							Pollination mutualisms are essential for tropical forests, but are threatened by forest fragmentation and degradation, which can lead to decline and loss of pollinator species. We studied the avian pollinators of three West African montane forest tree species, Anthonotha noldeae (dependent on birds for pollination), Anthocleista vogelii and Crown macrostachyus (with flowers characteristic of moth and insect pollination respectively). At 15 individuals of each tree species, we recorded bird visits and identified visitors as Pollinators, Secondary Pollinators and Robbers. In total, 25 bird species visited at least one of the three tree species, and eight visited all three. The Northern Double-collared Sunbird Cinnyris reichenowi and Orange-tufted Sunbird C. bouvieri pollinated all three tree species. The Variable Sunbird C. venustus pollinated only A. vogelii and A. noldeae. The Village Weaver Ploceus cucullatus occasionally pollinated A. vogelii. Nineteen bird species were considered Secondary Pollinators, while three were Robbers only. The Village Weaver behaved sometimes as a Pollinator, sometimes as a Secondary Pollinator and sometimes as a Robber. The frequency of bird visitation was higher on A. noldeae than on A. vogelii or C. macrostachyus. Four species of sunbird are crucial for the pollination of A. noldeae but the possibility exists for its pollination by Secondary Pollinators should sunbirds decline. Despite having flowers characteristic of insect pollination, both A. vogelii and C. macrostachyus are pollinated by sunbirds and perhaps the Village Weaver.								0331-3689								ZOOREC:ZOOR15112083631					J	ZOOR14908034541		Bird conservation in extremely small tropical rainforest patches in southwest China.		Chang, Xue; Quan, Rui-chang; Wang, Lin				Biological Conservation	158			188-195	Feb 2013	2013							Tropical forests support high levels of avian diversity but these areas have been impacted by extensive deforestation. The lowland tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna in southwest China is one such impacted hotspot. In this region, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations have replaced most of the original forest, but numerous small fragments of forest remain. To assess the value of these fragments to avian diversity, we classified the fifteen selected remnant forest patches into three size categories, <1 ha, 1-3 ha, and 36 ha, and conducted avifauna surveys. We found that 97 bird species inhabit the fragments and that bird diversity increases with patch area. The resident species composition similarity index was low among forest patches, both within and across size categories, and also low between the wet and dry seasons. Ground insectivores, frugivores and large bird species were the most vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Our study encouragingly shows that fragments can play an important role in bird conservation in regions that now lack large tracts of natural forest; however, current patches are too small to support stable annual populations of some species, while others are more tolerant of fragmentation. We discuss these findings and provide conservation strategies to improve bird conservation within rubber plantations in southern China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Pacific Conservation Biology	19	2		110-120	2013	2013							Birds in urban landscapes must contend with fragmented and degraded remnants of native vegetation and their survival may be dependent on factors such as their ability to disperse through and/or utilize the urban matrix. We examined the frequency of occurrence of birds in native bushland in Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia, and in nine adjacent suburban gardens. We quantified dispersal capacity by observing bird crossing frequency and height over a major six-lane road separating the bushland from adjacent gardens. Finally we quantified matrix utilisation by recording foraging behaviour in urban gardens and bushland. Native bushland had a higher species richness than urban gardens (30 versus 17 species) and 18 species Were associated more strongly with bushland. Of these 18 species, 61% were never recorded in urban gardens. Gardens were typified by three generalist species, the Singing Honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens and the introduced Laughing Dove Spilopelia senegalensis and Spotted Dove S. chinensis. Three generalist species, the Red Wattlebird Anthochaera carunculata, Rainbow Lorikeet Trichoglossus haematodus, and Brown Honeyeater Lichmera indistincta were equally abundant in all habitats. Four of 18 bird species (Singing Honeyeater Red Wattlebird, Rainbow Lorikeet, and Australian Ringneck Barnardius zonarius) accounted for the majority of road crossing events. Urban gardens provided a rich resource for generalists and urban exploiters, all of which spent significantly more time foraging on nectar in gardens and significantly more time foraging on insects in bushland. We conclude that urban gardens provide habitat for some species that exploit nectar, but most species in bushland, particularly insectivores, do not use gardens. Our results indicate the importance of retaining well-managed bushland for supporting viable urban bird populations.

Bieber, Ana Gabriela D.; Silva, Paulo S.D.; Oliveira, Paulo S.				Ecoscience	20	1		85-89	2013	2013							Interactions between ants and vertebrate-dispersed fleshy fruits are common on the floor of tropical forests. These interactions are considered beneficial to seeds if ants clean the seed (which may prevent fungal contamination and/ or increase germination success) or act as secondary fine-scale dispersers (depositing the seed in nearby nutrient-enriched nest sites). Benefits to seeds, however, may be constrained by limited ant access to fruits. Here, we experimentally tested whether ant access to fallen fleshy fruits of Psychotria suterella (Rubiaceae) can be affected by previous handling (including ingestion) by birds. We found that mandibulated fruits and fruits embedded in feces are more prone to be visited by ants compared to entirely intact fruits. Moreover, the number of ant species per station was higher for vertebrate-handled fruit categories. We suggest that ongoing vertebrate loss in tropical forests may affect this highly opportunistic and potentially mutualistic interaction.

Stevens, Helen C.; Watson, David M.				Emu	113	2		112-121	2013	2013							Declines of formerly widespread bird species are being increasingly reported, with habitat loss, agricultural intensification and reduced rainfall frequently implicated. We report on temporal changes in the occurrence of birds over 21 years within continuous forest in the Warrumbungle Mountains to evaluate the influence of rainfall variability on changes in the abundance of birds and species occurence. During this period, six common insectivores declined significantly (Superb Fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus; White-throated Gerygone, Gerygone albogularis; Grey Shrike-thrush, Colluricincla harmonica; Rufous Whistler, Pachycephala rufiventris; Grey Fantail, Rhipidura albiscapa; Eastern Yellow Robin, Eopsaltria australis). Rainfall significantly predicted the abundance of 13 of the 25 most common species, with the rainfall period of both July-December of the previous year and the combined effects of six years of January-June rainfall correlated with changes in the abundance of birds. Prolonged drought has likely driven food shortages (especially of litter-dwelling arthropods), with changes in avian community composition reflecting changes in food availability. Thus, avian declines in southern Australia may reflect the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and other landscape-scale changes in concert with larger-scale ecological processes driven by decreased rainfall. Improved linkages between forested and agricultural landscapes at the regional scale are needed to buffer against local fluctuations in resources.

Lohmus, Kertu; Liira, Jaan				Basic and Applied Ecology	13	8		165-173	2013	2013							One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations.

Korfanta, Nicole M.; Newmark, William D.; Kauffman, Matthew J.				Ecology (Washington D C)	93	12		2548-2559	Dec 2012	2012							Tropical deforestation continues to cause population declines and local extinctions in centers of avian diversity and endemism. Although local species extinctions stem from reductions in demographic rates, little is known about how habitat fragmentation influences survival of tropical bird populations or the relative importance of survival and fecundity in ultimately shaping communities. We analyzed 22 years of mark-recapture data to assess how fragmentation influenced apparent survival, recruitment, and realized population growth rate within 22 forest understory bird species in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. This represents the first such effort, in either tropical or temperate systems, to characterize the effect of deforestation on avian survival across such a broad suite of species. Long-term demographic analysis of this suite of species experiencing the same fragmented environment revealed considerable variability in species' responses to fragmentation, in addition to general patterns that emerged from comparison among species. Across the understory bird community as a whole, we found significantly lower apparent survival and realized population growth rate in small fragments relative to large, demonstrating fragmentation effects to demographic rates long after habitat loss. Demographic rates were depressed across five feeding guilds, suggesting that fragmentation sensitivity was not limited to insectivores. Seniority analyses, together with a positive effect of fragmentation on recruitment, indicated that depressed apparent survival was the primary driver of population declines and observed extinctions. We also found a landscape effect, with lower vital rates in one mountain range relative to another, suggesting that fragmentation effects may add to other large-scale drivers of population decline. Overall, realized population growth rate ([lambda]) estimates were <1 for most species, suggesting that future population persistence, even within large forest fragments, is uncertain in this biodiversity hotspot.								0012-9658							10.1890/11-1345.1	ZOOREC:ZOOR14906021762	23431586				J	ZOOR14906020003		Edge and area effects on avian assemblages and insectivory in fragmented native forests.		Barbaro, Luc; Brockerhoff, Eckehard G.; Giffard, Brice; van Halder, Inge				Landscape Ecology	27	10		1451-1463	Dec 2012	2012							Disentangling the confounded effects of edge and area in fragmented landscapes is a recurrent challenge for landscape ecologists, requiring the use of appropriate study designs. Here, we examined the effects of forest fragment area and plot location at forest edges versus interiors on native and exotic bird assemblages on Banks Peninsula (South Island, New Zealand). We also experimentally measured with plasticine models how forest fragment area and edge versus interior location influenced the intensity of avian insectivory. Bird assemblages were sampled by conducting 15 min point-counts at paired edge and interior plots in 13 forest fragments of increasing size (0.5-141 ha). Avian insectivory was measured as the rate of insectivorous bird attacks on plasticine models mimicking larvae of a native polyphagous moth. We found significant effects of edge, but not of forest patch area, on species richness, abundance and composition of bird assemblages. Exotic birds were more abundant at forest edges, while neither edge nor area effects were noticeable for native bird richness and abundance. Model predation rates increased with forest fragmentation, both because of higher insectivory in smaller forest patches and at forest edges. Avian predation significantly increased with insectivorous bird richness and foraging bird abundance. We suggest that the coexistence of native and exotic birds in New Zealand mosaic landscapes enhances functional diversity and trait complementation within predatory bird assemblages. This coexistence results in increased avian insectivory in small forest fragments through additive edge and area effects.

De La Vega, Xaviera; Grez, Audrey A.; Simonetti, Javier A.				Austral Ecology	37	7		836-844	November 2012	2012							The effects of forest fragmentation on ecological interactions and particularly on food webs have scarcely been analysed. There is usually less herbivory in forest fragments than in continuous forests. Here we hypothesize that forest fragmentation enhances top-down control of herbivory through an increase in insectivorous birds and a decrease in herbivorous insects, with a consequent decrease in plant reproductive success in small forest fragments. In the Maulino forest in central Chile, we experimentally excluded birds from Aristotelia chilensis (Elaeocarpaceae) trees in both forest fragments and continuous forest, and analysed herbivore insect abundance, herbivory and plant reproductive success during two consecutive growing seasons. We expected that insect abundance and herbivory would increase, and reproductive success would decrease in A. chilensis from which birds have been excluded, particularly in forest fragments where bird abundance and predation pressure on insects is higher. The abundance of herbivorous insects was lower in the forest fragments than in the continuous forest only in the first season, and herbivory was lower in forest fragments than in the continuous forest throughout the study. Moreover, during the second growing season herbivory was greater in the excluded trees than in the control trees, and as expected, there was a greater difference in the fragments than in the continuous forest, but this was not statistically significant. Exclusion of birds did not affect the reproductive success of A. chilensis. Our results, after 2 years of study, demonstrate that birds affect the levels of herbivory on A. chilensis in the Maulino forest, but do not support our hypothesis of enhanced top-down control in fragmented forests, as the strength of the effect of excluding birds did not vary with fragmentation.

Its breeding biology is poorly known despite its abundance and conspicuousness. We describe the nesting biology of Yellow-olive Flatbills from Atlantic Forest fragments in Belo Horizonte County, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Eighty nests were monitored every 3-5 days from August to January between 1995 and 2000. Active nests were found from mid-September through late December with a peak from mid October through late November. First clutches were usually laid during the first rains, but prior to the main peak in annual rainfall. The Yellow-olive Flatbill builds closed, pencile nests on tree branches along streams or roads, principally of dark fungal (Marasmius sp.) fibers. Clutch size ranged from two to four white eggs. Incubation was irregular and hatching was asynchronous. Incubation and nestling periods were 20 and 23 days, respectively. Nesting success across all 5 years was 29% (mean among years = 31%, Cl = 25-37%), and nest predation was the main cause of nest failure (49%). Mayfield estimates of nest survival were low (mean = 26%, Cl = 17-36%), and the probability of an egg to produce a fledgling was only 10%. Fledging success was 0.8 fledglings per breeding pair, and chicks fledged at 107% (CI = 106-108%) of mean adult body mass. Our results do not support the purported pattern of long breeding seasons for tropical birds. The Yellow-olive Flatbill laid unusually large clutches, had lower nest survival, and greater fledgling productivity compared with other tropical passerines. Received 28 April 2009.

Sampling sites were >2 km from natural forest fragments. Observations were made at 38 sites using 30-min point and transect counts in the morning and afternoon in the rainy season, season of northern winds, and dry season from June 2008 to May 2009. We observed 3,551 birds, which were assigned to 102 species: 72 were resident and 30 were migratory species. Overall efficiency of sampling was 82.4% and varied from 68.7% in linear agroforestry to 81.5% in animal agroforestry. Total species richness varied from 43 in sequential agroforestry to 64 in animal agroforestry. Species richness and Shannon diversity indices revealed no differences among agroforestry classes. Bird communities in animal agroforestry, linear agroforestry, and sequential agroforestry had similar species compositions, as did agroforests and crops tinder tree cover. Birds in all agroforestry classes were mainly forest generalists, although specialists of open areas were common, particularly in animal and sequential agroforestry. Only one individual of a forest specialist species was observed during sampling. Migrant species were mostly forest generalists, but some open area specialists occurred in animal agroforestry. Resident birds were distributed over all foraging guilds in all agroforestry classes, whereas migrants were mainly foliage-gleaning insectivores. Foraging guilds had different relative abundances among agroforestry classes. Structural diversity of agroforestry classes did not seem to influence bird species richness. Forest specialist species were virtually absent in agroforestry classes, but the avifauna in agroforestry is diverse and valuable in itself. Received 9 July 2010.

Condor	114	3		532-543	Aug 2012	2012							The Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is the largest of the three North American species of Accipiter and is more closely associated with older forests than are the other species. Its reliance on older forests has resulted in concerns about its status, extensive research into its habitat relationships, and litigation. Our objective was to model the spatial patterns of goshawk territories in the Black Hills, South Dakota, to make inferences about the underlying processes. We used a modification of Ripley's K function that accounts for inhomogeneous intensity to determine whether territoriality or habitat determined the spacing of goshawks in the Black Hills, finding that habitat conditions rather than territoriality were the determining factor. A spatial model incorporating basal area of trees in a stand of forest, canopy cover, age of trees >23 cm in diameter, number of trees per hectare, and geographic coordinates provided good fit to the spatial patterns of territories. There was no indication of repulsion at close distances that would imply spacing was determined by territoriality. These findings contrast with those for the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, where territoriality is an important limiting factor. Forest stands where the goshawk nested historically are now younger and have trees of smaller diameter, probably having been modified by logging, fire, and insects. These results have important implications for the goshawk's ecology in the Black Hills with respect to mortality, competition, forest fragmentation, and nest-territory protection.

Magrach, Ainhoa; Santamaria, Luis; Larrinaga, Asier R.				Austral Ecology	37	5		600-609	August 2012	2012							Forest fragmentation produces sharp changes in the spatial configuration of remnant forest patches, which include the increasing influence of patch edges on the interior of forest patches (edge effects). Human activities responsible for forest fragmentation tend also to change the internal characteristics of remnant patches, for example, through the creation of gaps by selective logging. While edges and gaps can be expected to cause comparable changes in the micro-environmental conditions of the forest, their effects on forest-dwelling species and their interactions are not necessarily comparable. This study compares the effect of forest edges and anthropogenic gaps on the reproductive success of a self-incompatible epiphytic plant (Mitraria coccinea), mediated by changes in its relationship with mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (flower larcenists). Mitraria coccinea's flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and robbed by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. Edges and gaps had comparable positive effects on flower production and fruit set; however, nectar robbing was up to sevenfold higher in patches with numerous gaps and resulted in lower reproductive success (fruit set and total fruit crop). Forest fragmentation studies should therefore avoid treating forest remnants as homogeneous units (i.e. focusing exclusively on their characteristics and connectivity), without taking into account the internal heterogeneity caused by anthropogenic pressures (e.g. gaps and edge effects).

Woltmann, Stefan; Kreiser, Brian R.; Sherry, Thomas W.				Conservation Genetics	13	4		925-935	Aug 2012	2012							We studied five populations of a rainforest understory insectivorous bird (Myrmeciza exsul, chestnut-backed antbird) in a fragmented landscape in northeastern Costa Rica in order to test hypotheses about the influence of forest fragmentation on population genetic structure using 16 microsatellite loci. Bayesian assignment approaches-perhaps the most conservative analyses we performed-consistently grouped the sites into two distinct groups, with all individuals from the smallest and most isolated population clustering separately from the other four sites. Additional analyses revealed (1) overall significant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differentiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and (3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by elevated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites. Our results are somewhat surprising given the small geographic distances between sites (11-34 km) and the short time ([approximately]60 years) since wide-spread deforestation in this landscape. We suspect fine-scale genetic structure may occur in many resident tropical bird species, and in the case of the chestnut-backed antbird it appears that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has important population genetic implications. It appears that chestnut-backed antbirds may persist in fragmented landscapes in the absence of significant migration among patches, but mechanisms that allow this species to persist when many other similar species do not are not well understood.

Tvardikova, Katerina; Novotny, Vojtech				Journal of Tropical Ecology	28	4		331-341	Jul 2012	2012							Although predation is generally seen as one of the key factors determining the abundance and composition of insect herbivore communities in tropical rain forests, quantitative estimates of predation pressure in rain-forest habitats remain rare. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies on semi-concealed and exposed caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in lowland and montane tropical rain forests, using plasticine models of caterpillars. We recorded attacks on caterpillars in four habitats: primary forest, secondary forest and forest fragment in lowlands (200 m asl), and montane primary forest (1700 m asl). We used 300 exposed and 300 semi-concealed caterpillars daily, and conducted the experiment for 6 d in every habitat. Daily incidence of attacks was higher on exposed caterpillars (4.95%) than on semi-concealed (leaf-rolling) caterpillars (2.99%). Attack pressure of natural enemies differed also among habitats. In the lowlands, continuous primary and secondary forests had similar daily incidence of attacks (2.39% and 2.36%) which was however lower than that found in a primary forest fragment (4.62%). This difference was caused by higher incidence of attacks by birds, ants and wasps in the forest fragment. The most important predators were birds in montane rain forests (61.9% of identified attacks), but insect predators, mostly ants, in the lowlands (58.3% of identified attacks). These results suggest that rapid decrease in the abundance of ants with altitude may be compensated by increased importance of birds as predators in montane forests. Further, it suggests that small rain-forest fragments may suffer from disproportionately high pressure from natural enemies, with potentially serious consequences for survival of their herbivorous communities.

We evaluated the diversity within bird feeding guilds as related to habitat heterogeneity and land-use cover in a human-modified tropical landscape. To quantify this process, fine-scale bird census and habitat heterogeneity data were collected for a bird community in a 22.5-km2 fragmented landscape in southern Mexico. Land-use cover data derived from field surveys were used to calculate habitat heterogeneity index values and the extent of each land-use cover type in 239 grid cells of 300 x 300 m. Bird diversity values were obtained based on 1195 point-counts in these cells. Product-moment correlations and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between bird-guild diversity values and habitat heterogeneity. A total of 109 resident bird species grouped in six feeding guilds were recorded: insectivores (42%), frugivores (21%), granivores (17%), nectarivores (9%), omnivores (8%) and carnivores (3%). Diversity values for the entire bird community were significantly positively related to habitat heterogeneity, but feeding guilds showed contrasting responses to habitat heterogeneity and the amount of land-use cover: insectivores and frugivores were more diverse and abundant in secondary forests than in any other land-cover. Our findings illustrate the importance of small landscape fragments as potential key refuges for the most diverse and specialized feeding guilds, such as granivores and insectivores.

Community Ecology	13	1		82-87	Jun 2012	2012							Habitat isolation is expected to reduce population densities of animals via reduced immigration. However, altered trophic interactions in isolated habitats may modify these effects, especially since the strength of isolation effects is expected to increase with trophic rank. Here, we studied effects of habitat isolation on a food-web module consisting of herbivorous beetles, predatory spiders, spider-preying wasps and arthropod-feeding birds. We compare two systems that were studied in subsequent years: a study on 29 mature apple orchards that varied in the degree of isolation from forest, and a study on 20 groups of newly planted cherry trees that showed similar variation in their degree of habitat isolation. No birds were observed on the young fruit trees. Wasps and spiders showed the expected lower abundances in isolated habitats. On mature trees, birds were present and showed lower abundances in isolated habitats. Wasps were reduced to a similar degree by habitat isolation as on the young trees. Surprisingly, spider densities on the mature trees were higher in isolated than in connected habitat. This contrasting response of spiders to habitat isolation is likely to be due to release from bird predation in isolated mature orchards. In both study systems, beetles showed no significant effect of habitat isolation. Our results confirm that the sensitivity to fragmentation increases with trophic rank, and suggest that trophic interactions should receive more attention in fragmentation studies.

Zurita, Gustavo A.; Bellocq, Maria I.				Biotropica	44	3		412-419	May 2012	2012							Traditional approaches to the study of species persistence in fragmented landscapes generally consider a binary classification of habitat being suitable or unsuitable; however, the range of human-modified habitats within a region may offer a gradient of habitat suitability (or conservation value) for species. We identified such a gradient by comparing bird assemblages among contrasting land uses (pine plantations of different age, annual crops, clear cuts and cattle pastures) in the Upper Parana Atlantic forest. Bird assemblages and vegetation structure were characterized in an extensive area of 4400 km2 in Argentina and Paraguay during the breeding seasons of 2005-2010. Similarity of bird assemblages between anthropogenic habitats and the native forest and the proportion of forest species increased with vegetation vertical structure, while the proportion of open-area species decreased. As a consequence, mature tree plantations were the most suitable habitats for forest species and were mainly used by frugivores and bark insectivores. In contrast, open habitats were the least suitable habitat for forest species and were used primarily by insectivores. Human-created habitats that are structurally complex can be used by a subset of forest species, and may improve functional connectivity and mitigate edge effects. The conservation of large tracks of native forests, however, is critical for the long-term persistence of the entire bird assemblage, especially for native forest dependent species.								0006-3606								ZOOREC:ZOOR14808054803					J	ZOOR14809063249		Diurnal raptors foraging on flying leaf-cutter ants (Atta sp.) in a fragmented landscape of the Atlantic rainforest, southeastern Brazil.

This event is commonly harnessed by opportunistic birds, because the ants have a high nutritional value. There are few records of predations of flocks of these alate ants in Brazil. The present report describes the behaviour of an assemblage of diurnal birds of prey foraging on reproductive alates of Atta sp. in flight in a forest fragment at Cachoeiras de Macacu, state of Rio de Janeiro. In the event there were observed only raptors. No inter or intraspecific agonistic behaviour among Accipitriformes (Harpagus diodon, Heterospizias meridionalis and Rupornis magnirostris) and Falconiformes (Milvago chimachima and Caracara plancus) was observed. During the event, only H. diodon changed its hunting behaviour from the typical sit-and-wait to the active search behaviour. The absence of agonistic, as well as the change in hunting and territorial behaviours, were possibly explained by the locally ephemeral high food abundance.

Martin, Emily A.; Viano, Marion; Ratsimisetra, Lailana; Laloe, Francis; Carriere, Stephanie M.				Agriculture Ecosystems &  Environment	149			1-9	Mar 1 2012	2012							In Madagascar, despite acute land use pressure on forests coupled with unprecedented loss of endemic species and natural habitats, data on species distributions outside natural habitats are strikingly scarce. In this study, this gap is addressed by measuring bird diversity both within a protected forest corridor, and in the agricultural mosaic surrounding it. Results show that the diversity of all birds, and also of several functional guilds was higher in the mosaic than in the corridor. Moreover, 69% of all species found in the forest (61% of those classified as forest species) also occupied the agricultural mosaic. The diversity of frugivores, canopy insectivores and forest species in the mosaic was highly dependent upon the variety of scattered trees, small forest patches, plantations and secondary habitats distributed throughout the landscape. Generalist frugivores were particularly abundant in the mosaic, implying high potential for the maintenance of seed dispersal and fallow regeneration ecosystem services. Forest species in the mosaic were more generalist and less abundant, however, than those in the forest, suggesting the presence of both source-sink dynamics and potential biotic homogenization of the community in this landscape. Although under current conditions of heterogeneity and composition, the agricultural mosaic harbors a significant proportion of the endemic bird community, this study confirms the need for both sustained protection of large forest areas, and for adequate management of the agricultural landscape, particularly through the maintenance and enhancement of old-growth and isolated tree structures and fragments.

Ruiz-Guerra, Betsabe; Renton, Katherine; Dirzo, Rodolfo				Biotropica	44	2		228-236	Mar 2012	2012							The consequences of habitat alteration on the role of understory insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects in tropical forests are poorly understood. To examine whether fragmentation may affect the topdown controls of herbivory, we compared the number of species, individuals, and the community structure of insectivorous birds between fragments and continuous tropical moist forest in Mexico. We also registered insect herbivore abundances and conducted a larvae predation experiment to evaluate the potential role of insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects. We recorded 63 bird species from 22 families, 43 percent of which were insectivorous birds. Species richness, abundance, and diversity of the avian community were higher in continuous forest compared with forest fragments. For insectivorous birds in particular, there was low similarity in avian insectivore communities between forest types, and forest fragments had more heavily dominated communities of avian insectivores. During the dry season, forest fragments presented significantly higher predation rates on artificial caterpillars, and lower abundance of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae, compared with continuous forest. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between artificial caterpillar predation rate and larval Lepidoptera abundance, with higher rates of predation in sample sites of low Lepidoptera abundance. Hence, the potentially greater light in the dry season combined with a more dominated avian insectivore community in forest fragments may facilitate increased predation by avian insectivores, resulting in a decline in abundance of larval Lepidoptera, with implications for the process of insect-driven herbivory in forest fragments.

Santiago-Alarcon, Diego; Havelka, Peter; Schaefer, Hinrich Martin; Segelbacher, Gernot				PLoS ONE	7	2		e31098, 1-5	2012	2012	http://ukpmc.ac.uk/journals/1217/						Changing environmental conditions and human encroachment on natural habitats bring human populations closer to novel sources of parasites, which might then develop into new emerging diseases. Diseases transmitted by host generalist vectors are of special interest due to their capacity to move pathogens into novel hosts. We hypothesize that humans using forests for recreation are exposed to a broad range of parasites from wild animals and their vectors. A corollary of this is that new vector-host, parasite-host, and vector-parasite associations could eventually develop. Thus, we expect to observe atypical vector-host associations. Using molecular bloodmeal analysis via amplification of the mtDNA COI gene we identified the vertebrate hosts of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species in a sub-urban forest of Southwestern Germany. Bloodmeals were also checked for haemosporidian infections by amplifying a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b gene. We identified a total of 20 Culicoides species, thirteen of which fed on humans. From 105 screened bloodmeals we obtained high quality sequences for 77 samples, 73 (94.8%) originated from humans, two from livestock (Bos taurus and Equus caballus), and two from wild birds (Sylvia atricapilla and Turdus merula). We found that four Culicoides species previously assumed to feed exclusively on either birds (C. kibunensis) or domestic mammals (C. chiopterus, C. deltus, C. scoticus) fed also on humans. A total of six Culicoides abdomens were infected with avian haemosporidian parasites (Plasmodium or Haemoproteus), four of those abdomens contained blood derived from humans. Our results suggest that parasites of wild animals may be transferred to humans through infectious bites of Culicoides vectors. Further, we show that Culicoides vectors believed to be a specialist on specific vertebrate groups can have plastic feeding preferences, and that Culicoides are susceptible to infection by Plasmodium parasites, though vector viability must still be experimentally demonstrated.

A influencia da fragmentacao da mata ciliar sobre a avifauna na Bacia Hidrografica do Rio Cai, Rio Grande do Sul.	Brummelhaus, Jaqueline; Weber, Jessica; Petry, Maria Virginia				Neotropical Biology and Conservation	7	1		57-66	January-April 2012	2012							Riparian zones of watercourses contribute to the conservation of birds, since they are used as ecological corridors for moving between forests by many species. The disturbance of these areas impacts negatively the species diversity of the regions. This study reports on the richness, abundance and feeding guilds of birds in different widths of riparian forest along watercourses, in Ca River Hydrographic Basin, Rio Grande do Sul. Eighteen fixed points of observation were randomized, at least 200 meters apart from each other, classified into three treatments of riparian forest width. Four observations were conducted at each point between January and May in 2009. The richness of bird species did not vary significantly between treatments, but we noticed that the composition varied according to the characteristics of each area, and a total of 97 species were identified. We recorded the presence of Limnoctites rectirostris, which is listed as an endangered species. Abundance, with 785 individuals, varied between treatments, with greater abundance of generalist species, which easily find resources in most environments, such as insectivorous birds, in areas with smaller riparian forest. We note that the fragmentation of riparian forest affects the ability to suit the needs of bioindicator birds because they use these environments for feeding, breeding and resting, and as ecological corridors. Thus, the restoration and preservation of riparian forests with a minimum coverage of 30 meters of the original vegetation are essential for bird species that indicate good environmental quality.			petry, maria/K-8410-2013	petry, maria/0000-0002-7870-7394				1809-9939								ZOOREC:ZOOR14808056362					J	ZOOR14804030192		Seed dispersal and predation in the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana on two islands with different faunal richness, southern Brazil.		da Silva, Fernanda R.; Begnini, Romualdo M.; Lopes, Benedito C.; Castellani, Tania T.				Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment	46	3		163-171	December 2011	2011							Palms are considered key species in tropical forests and represent a source of food for the community of frugivores in times of scarcity. Palms have also been used as a model to investigate how the processes of dispersal and seed predation are affected by fragmentation and alteration of tropical forests. This study examines the dispersal and seed predation of Syagrus romanzoffiana in two insular environments of different sizes (1500 ha and 50 ha) and faunal compositions, both located in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. We recorded 13 species of animals considered consumers and dispersers of fruits and seeds of S. romanzoffiana at the larger study area (Peri Lagoon Municipal Park, Santa Catarina Island) and five species on Campeche Island. In these areas, the rates of dispersal were high (Peri 57.5% to 75.5% and Campeche 81.5% to 93.0%, based on the removal experiments). In the smaller area, despite the low faunal richness, the coatis (Nasua nasua), introduced in the island were important seed dispersers. Only in Peri occurred predation by rodents (rates of 4%) due to the presence of agoutis (Dasyprocta azarae) and there was no post-dispersal predation by insects. The greatest loss of seeds (52% in both locations, based on sampling of seeds accumulated under parent plants) were caused by predation of Revena rubiginosa (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), of which oviposition occurs in the pre-dispersal phase. Besides this factor, about 40% of the seeds showed up without endosperm. However, high seed production seems to compensate for these losses, with significant seedling stock of S. romanzoffiana in both areas.

Otieno, Nickson Erick; Gichuki, Nathan; Farwig, Nina; Kiboi, Samuel				African Journal of Ecology	49	4		410-417	Dec 2011	2011							Although it is clear that the farmlands neighbouring fragmented forests are utilized by some forest birds, it is not clear how birds in general respond to farmland habitat mosaic. An effort was made to determine how bird density and foraging assemblages were influenced by farm structural characteristics and distance from forest edge. Thirty farms up to a distance of 12 km around Kakamega forest in western Kenya were studied. Farm structure entailed size, hedge volume, habitat heterogeneity, woody plant density, plant diversity and crop cover. Birds were surveyed using line transects and DISTANCE analyses and classified into six feeding guilds and three habitat associations. Size of farms increased away from the forest, as woody plant density, plant diversity, indigenous trees and subsistence crop cover declined. The most important farm structure variable was hedge volume, which enhanced bird species richness, richness of shrub-land bird species and insectivorous bird density (R = 0.58, P < 0.01). Bird density increased with tree density while indigenous trees were suitable for insectivores and nectarivores. There were very few forest bird encounters. Agricultural practices incorporating maintenance of hedges and sound selection of agroforestry trees can enhance conservation of birds on farmland, though, not significantly for forest species.

Uezu, Alexandre; Metzger, Jean Paul				Biodiversity and Conservation	20	14		3627-3643	Dec 2011	2011							Patch size, isolation, and vegetation structure are expected to strongly affect species persistence in fragmented landscapes, particularly for those with <30% of native habitat remaining. Those influences should be modulated by species characteristics, resulting in complex relationships. In order to investigate how species, habitat structure and landscape factors are related and how they affected species persistence, we studied bird communities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. Patch size strongly affected species richness and population abundances. However, some functional groups were more affected than others, particularly endemic and understory insectivores, species that are near the limits of their geographical distribution, those using few forest types, and those with their center of abundance in high altitude tropical forests. The effect of vegetation structure was mainly at the species level, reflecting specific responses to habitat quality. The importance of landscape variables varies according to the species group. For the most affected ones, which usually have low dispersal capacity, patch size and quality were the most relevant factors, whereas patch isolation was associated with the richness of groups with more generalist species. This pattern is due to the limited structural connectivity in the study region, composed of low matrix permeability (e.g. pastures and sugar cane), which isolate the most affected species, making them more dependent on local factors. In such a fragmented landscape, the largest patches should be prioritized for conservation purposes, as they aggregate the most vulnerable species and present the highest alpha diversity. Landscape management, as such, should also reconnect large fragments through corridors or matrix improvements, promoting better conditions for long-term persistence of the most affected species.

A first attempt to gather quantitative data.		Carpaneto, Giuseppe Maria; Mazziotta, Adriano; Maltzeff, Paolo				Journal of Insect Conservation	15	6		833-837	Dec 2011	2011							We attempt to identify the threat to flying beetles imposed by mist nets deployed for bird studies in an area of Mediterranean mosaic of evergreen scrub and deciduous forest in Italy. The present paper is the first attempt to identify the non-target species which die in these artificial traps. A large number of large scarab beetles was entangled in mist nets during a complete ringing session. The seasonal trend of beetle populations and their daily flight activity were also recorded. The results lead us to suggest that the populations of some threatened dung beetles can be impoverished at local level and represent a bycatch of mist net techniques, especially in early spring and at sunrise, when their swarming and reproductive activity is high. When summed with other factors affecting these beetles, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, this tool may represent a threat for vulnerable insect populations. Trapping effects may also represent a depletion of food resource for some insectivorous birds. For these reasons we recommend cooperative research between ornithologists and entomologists to fully study the bycatch effects of mist netting on flying insects and their effects on food availability for insectivorous birds.

Royal Society Philosophical Transactions Biological Sciences	366	1582		3265-3276	Nov 27 2011	2011							Large areas of tropical forest now exist as remnants scattered across agricultural landscapes, and so understanding the impacts of forest fragmentation is important for biodiversity conservation. We examined species richness and nestedness among tropical forest remnants in birds (meta-analysis of published studies) and insects (field data for fruit-feeding Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and ants). Species-area relationships were evident in all four taxa, and avian and insect assemblages in remnants typically were nested subsets of those in larger areas. Avian carnivores and nectarivores and predatory ants were more nested than other guilds, implying that the sequential loss of species was more predictable in these groups, and that fragmentation alters the trophic organization of communities. For butterflies, the ordering of fragments to achieve maximum nestedness was by fragment area, suggesting that differences among fragments were driven mainly by extinction. In contrast for moths, maximum nestedness was achieved by ordering species by wing length; species with longer wings (implying better dispersal) were more likely to occur at all sites, including low diversity sites, suggesting that differences among fragments were driven more strongly by colonization. Although all four taxa exhibited high levels of nestedness, patterns of species turnover were also idiosyncratic, and thus even species-poor sites contributed to landscape-scale biodiversity, particularly for insects.

Posa, Mary Rose C.				Biological Conservation	144	10		2548-2556	Oct 2011	2011							Peat swamp forest is a unique wetland ecosystem covering extensive areas in Southeast Asia that has received relatively little scientific attention and is now being lost at a rapid pace. This study examines the effects of anthropogenic degradation on bird communities in disturbed peat swamp forest Habitats - namely, intact logged forest, a degraded forest fragment, and non-forest regrowth - in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Results show that species richness was significantly higher and species composition significantly different in intact logged forest in comparison to the degraded forest fragment and non-forested area. Nectarivore and tree foliage-gleaning insectivore abundance declined outside the intact forest, while the regrowth was dominated by the yellow vented bulbul, an open country insectivore-frugivore. Surveys reveal that large intact tracts of logged peat swamp forest can harbour threatened and near threatened bird species (36% of records) and thus play a role in their conservation, especially for a few habitat specialists. Given the extent of unmanaged degraded peatlands and continuing pressure to develop them, urgent conservation actions are needed to rehabilitate and protect this ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ramos de Oliveira, Paulo Roberto, Jr; Alberts, Carlos Camargo; Francisco, Mercival Roberto				Biotropica	43	5		628-632	Sep 2011	2011							Recent studies on the impacts of forest fragmentation on understory insectivorous birds in the Neotropics have highlighted that even narrow linear clearings, such as roads, can affect the movements of this guild of birds. We used playback trials of territorial vocalizations to assess the movements of three understory insectivorous bird species across two unpaved roads bisecting Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho in southeast Brazil, located within one of the largest remaining continuous Atlantic Forests. Movement patterns varied among species. While Chamaeza campanisona never crossed these roads, Pyriglena leucoptera crossed them in almost 100 percent of tests. Although Conopophaga lineata exhibited a significantly lower number of crossings along cleared sites, it was eventually willing to traverse the roads, showing an intermediate pattern. Shaded areas with connected canopy did not improve birds' willingness to cross roads compared with areas where treecrowns were at least 3 m apart. Similarly, birds' willingness to cross an 8-m wide road with limited traffic (six vehicles/wk) was not significantly greater than that of a 12-m wide road with more intense traffic (41 vehicles/d). Our findings suggest that the negative impact of roads on bird movement is an issue that should be addressed by managers of Atlantic Forest conservation units, especially as economic development results in pressure to pave and widen roads.

The capacity of haemosporidians to infect insects has clear evolutionary consequences for the transmission of diseases. Here, we investigated (i) the associations between blood parasites, biting midges and birds and (ii) the potential specificity between biting midge and haemosporidian haplotypes. A total of 629 parous biting midges Culicoides and 224 wild birds (belonging to seven species) from a locality of central Spain were individually examined for the presence of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites by sequencing a fragment of cytochrome B. Biting midges were identified morphologically and characterized on the basis of a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene. Overall, 12 Haemoproteus and three Plasmodium haplotypes were isolated and sequenced. Among them, 10 haplotypes were exclusively isolated from biting midges, three haplotypes only from birds and two haplotypes from both biting midges and birds. Biting midge haplotypes showed both specific and generalist relationships with Haemoproteus haplotypes but only generalist relationships with Plasmodium haplotypes. Several C. festivipennis and C. kibunesis haplotypes established significant coevolutionary links with Haemoproteus haplotypes. These results shed light on the specificity of interactions between vectors and blood parasites.			la Puente, Josue Martinez-de/E-8597-2011; Martinez-de la Puente, Josue/B-1648-2008; Merino, Santiago/A-6183-2008; Martinez, Javier/H-2827-2015	la Puente, Josue Martinez-de/0000-0001-8055-4115; Merino, Santiago/0000-0003-0603-8280; Martinez, Javier/0000-0003-2657-1154				0962-1083								ZOOREC:ZOOR14710072198	21627703				J	ZOOR14803026158		SEASONAL VARIATION OF AVIFAUNAL COMPOSITION AND COMMUNITIES IN FOOTHILL GALLERY FOREST FRAGMENTS IN THE MANZANARES RIVER MEDIUM BASIN, STATE OF SUCRE, VENEZUELA.

Birds samples were taken monthly by point counts and mist-nets. Correlation analysis and non parametric tests were estimated to examine differences among seasonal periods. 73 species were recorded and were grouped into 7 feeding guilds. Mean diversity of both periods was high but no significant; although dry period diversity was moderately higher than rainy period. Richness and diversity showed no significant differences among periods, neither showed significant correlation with rainy levels. Occurrence frequency showed unusual > eventual > habitual > prevalent species pattern. Complementary index showed a substantial mean similarity monthly (67%). For both methods species cumulative curves displayed similar growing patterns. Insectivores and frugivores-insectivores were the most diverse feeding guilds. Amazilia tobaci obtained the highest specific importance index. Pitangus sulphuratus was the most persistent species. Community dynamic of avifauna of these riparian landscape would seem be influenced primarily to a suitable resources availability because to vertical and horizontal floristic heterogeneity. Conservation plans for medium basin of Manzanares river should take into account regular deforestation activities, particularly periodic and uncontrolled burnings, which likely would affect more adversely species associated with understory habitats.								1816-0719; 1994-9073								ZOOREC:ZOOR14803026158					J	ZOOR14710071169		Landscape matrix mediates occupancy dynamics of Neotropical avian insectivores.		Kennedy, Christina M.; Grant, Evan H. Campbell; Neel, Maile C.; Fagan, William F.; Marra, Peter P.				Ecological Applications	21	5		1837-1850	Jul 2011	2011							In addition to patch-level attributes (i.e., area and isolation), the nature of land cover between habitat patches (the matrix) may drive colonization and extinction dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Despite a long-standing recognition of matrix effects in fragmented systems, an understanding of the relative impacts of different types of land cover on patterns and dynamics of species occurrence remains limited. We employed multi-season occupancy models to determine the relative influence of patch area, patch isolation, within-patch vegetation structure, and landscape matrix on occupancy dynamics of nine Neotropical insectivorous birds in 99 forest patches embedded in four matrix types (agriculture, suburban development, bauxite mining, and forest) in central Jamaica. We found that within-patch vegetation structure and the matrix type between patches were more important than patch area and patch isolation in determining local colonization and local extinction probabilities, and that the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation structure on occupancy dynamics tended to be matrix and species dependent. Across the avian community, the landscape matrix influenced local extinction more than local colonization, indicating that extinction processes, rather than movement, likely drive interspecific differences in occupancy dynamics. These findings lend crucial empirical support to the hypothesis that species occupancy dynamics in fragmented systems may depend greatly upon the landscape context.

Journal of Biogeography	38	6		1186-1196	Jun 2011	2011							Aim To compare the ability of island biogeography theory, niche theory and species-energy theory to explain patterns of species richness and density for breeding bird communities across islands with contrasting characteristics. Location Thirty forested islands in two freshwater lakes in the boreal forest zone of northern Sweden (65[degree]55' N to 66[degree]09' N; 17[degree]43' E to 17[degree]55' E). Methods We performed bird censuses on 30 lake islands that have each previously been well characterized in terms of size, isolation, habitat heterogeneity (plant diversity and forest age), net primary productivity (NPP), and invertebrate prey abundance. To test the relative abilities of island biogeography theory, niche theory and species-energy theory to describe bird community patterns, we used both traditional statistical approaches (linear and multiple regressions) and structural equation modelling (SEM; in which both direct and indirect influences can be quantified). Results Using regression-based approaches, area and bird abundance were the two most important predictors of bird species richness. However, when the data were analysed by SEM, area was not found to exert a direct effect on bird species richness. Instead, terrestrial prey abundance was the strongest predictor of bird abundance, and bird abundance in combination with NPP was the best predictor of bird species richness. Area was only of indirect importance through its positive effect on terrestrial prey abundance, but habitat heterogeneity and spatial subsidies (emerging aquatic insects) also showed important indirect influences. Thus, our results provided the strongest support for species-energy theory. Main conclusions Our results suggest that, by using statistical approaches that allow for analyses of both direct and indirect influences, a seemingly direct influence of area on species richness can be explained by greater energy availability on larger islands. As such, animal community patterns that seem to be in line with island biogeography theory may be primarily driven by energy availability. Our results also point to the need to consider several aspects of habitat quality (e.g. heterogeneity, NPP, prey availability and spatial subsidies) for successful management of breeding bird diversity at local spatial scales and in fragmented or insular habitats.

Estudo comparativo entre as comunidades de aves de dois fragmentos florestais de caatinga em Pernambuco, Brasil.	Pereira, Glauco Alves; Azavedo Junior, Severino Mendes de				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	19	1		22-31	Marco 2011	2011							Our aim in this study was to survey birds in two forest fragments of caatinga (shrubby physiognomy), and to assess similarities in species compositions. The fragments, Serra do Mudo (SM) and Fazenda Pindorama (FP), are located in Porteiras, in the municipality of Altinho, State of Pernambuco. Identification was done by observation and recognition of bird vocalizations. Field work was performed between April and September 2007, comprising 4 visits. In a sampling effort of 100 h, we recorded 138 species, distributed among 44 families: SM (112 sp) and FP (121 sp). The fragments showed higher similarity between the avifauna. The insectivores and omnivores were dominant in both areas. Two migrants were recorded: Elaenia albiceps (southern migrant) and Tringa solitaria (northern migrant). Only one threatened species was recorded: Carduellis yarrellii. Most species did not have forest abundance, as well as showed low sensitivity.

Johnson, Erik I.; Stouffer, Philip C.; Vargas, Claideir F.				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	19	1		1-16	Marco 2011	2011							Amazonian forest bird communities are among the richest in the world. Even so, relatively little is known about the organization of the entire avian community at local scales or about differences across Amazonia. These are fundamental data not only for understanding the processes generating and maintaining tropical diversity, but also as a baseline for evaluating anthropogenic changes to Amazonian forests. Here we provide a description of the entire bird community for a 100 ha plot of terra firme forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil, based on spot-map and mist net surveys augmented by additional field and analytical techniques. Although our results are from a single plot surveyed in a single year, our methods and interpretation reflect nearly 30 ears of ornithological research at the site. We found 228 species on the plot, of which 207 were considered part of the core regional avifauna. Median density was five individuals/100 ha. Only 13 species (6% of the core species) had densitie >= 20 individuals on the plot, although 55 species (27%) had <=2 individuals. No species had territories smaller than 3 ha; median territory size was 11ha for the 103 species for which we could make reasonable estimates. Measured by numbers of species or individuals, the plot was dominated by insectivores (54% of species, 62% of individuals). Biomass, however, was dominated by frugivores and granivores (59%). Compared to available data from other Amazonian forests, our site appears to have comparable richness of a similar set of species, but lower density and greater patchiness. Our results suggest that the area required to support populations of many species will be even greater in central Amazonia than in western Amazonia.

Campanaro, Alessandro; Toni, Ilaria; Hardersen, Soenke; Grasso, Donato A.				Entomologia Generalis	33	1-2		79-89	2011	2011							In Italy, Lucanus cervus (Linnaeus 1758) generally lives in oak forests characterized by the presence of old trees. Such habitats are critically rare and fragmented. L cervus is listed in Annex II of the Habitats Directive and according to article 17, needs to be monitored by member states. However, methods for monitoring populations of L cervus have so far only been proposed for single countries and these are mostly not quantitative. In Italy survey data for L cervus are scarce and no national monitoring protocol has been proposed. At Bosco Fontana, a Nature Reserve in Northern Italy, remains of predation of L cervus can easily be found along forest roads and it seems that the main predator is the hooded crow (Corms cornix cornix). The preliminary study presented here, which is based on the collection of these remains, had the following aims: quantify the number of remains which can be sampled at Bosco Fontana, investigate the temporal pattern of the remains and estimate the phenology of L cervus, analyze the spatial distribution of the remains found and analyze the results with a view to monitoring L cervus by means of collecting remains of predation. The survey was carried out by searching all remains of predation of L cervus, from May to August 2008. In this period the road network of the reserve (23 km in total) was walked on a weekly basis. A total of 306 remains were collected (95 % males), which confirmed that these searches of remains were an efficient way of monitoring male L cervus. The remains were distributed non-homogeneously and most were found in a restricted number of roads. The data collected were used to estimate that L cervus was on the wing in the reserve from the first week of May to the first week of August. The implications of the results for monitoring L cervus are discussed.

The objective of this work was to survey the avifauna of the PoYo D'Anta Municipal Biological Reserve (277 ha), a forest patch at Juiz de Fora county, southeastern Minas Gerais, determining its ecological traits and conservation status. The survey was conducted between March-September 2007 and March 2008-May 2009 using Mackinnon lists, mist-net captures and occasional observations. We identified 157 species, of which 44 (28%) are endemic to the Atlantic Forest and six (3.8%) are of conservation concern. Among the threatened species, five are forest dependent (Dysithamnus stictothorax, Drymophila ochropyga, Sporophila frontalis, Sporophila falcirostris, Cyanoloxia moesta ). In general the community is characterized by birds with medium to low sensitivity to environmental perturbations. However, eight (5.1%) species with high sensitivity (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana, Conopophaga melanops, Sclerurus scansor, Xiphorhynchus fuscus, Lepidocolaptes squamatus, Campylorhamphus falcularius, Anabazenops fuscus and Habia rubica ) were identified. Moreover, some species once considered extinct in several other fragments in southeastern Minas Gerais were still present in the area. Insectivorous (39.5%, n = 62) and omnivorous (31.2%, n = 49) species were predominant. As a legally protected area and due to its extension, considering the regional characteristics, the PoYo D'Anta Municipal Biological Reserve has an important role in harboring populations of birds that has facing persistence anthropogenic effects in the region. The local avifauna is subject to impacts such as running overs, invasions of exotic species and hunting, although there are proposals of mitigation measures in the management plan of the area. It is emphasized the character of urgency regarding the implementation of these measures in order to minimize the impacts suffered by birds.

Szabo, Judit K.; Vesk, Peter A.; Baxter, Peter W.J.; Possingham, Hugh P.				Emu	111	1		59-70	2011	2011							Approximately 90% of the original woodlands of the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia has been cleared, modified or fragmented, most severely in the last 60 years, and affecting the avifauna dependent on native vegetation. This study identifies which woodland-dependent species are still declining in two different habitats, Pink Gum-Blue Gum woodland and Stringybark woodland. Weanalyse the Mount Lofty Ranges Woodland Bird Long-Term Monitoring Dataset for 1999-2007, to look for changes in abundance of 59 species. Weuse logistic regression of prevalence on lists in a Bayesian framework, and List Length Analysis to control for variation in detectability. Compared with Reporting Rate Analysis, a more traditional approach, List Length Analysis provides tighter confidence intervals by accounting for changing detectability. Several common species were declining significantly. Increasers were generally large-bodied generalists. Many birds have already disappeared from this modified and naturally isolated woodland island, and our results suggest that more specialist insectivores are likely to follow. The Mount Lofty Ranges can be regarded as a 'canary landscape' for temperate woodlands elsewhere in Australia-without immediate action their bird communities are likely to follow the trajectory of the Mount Lofty Ranges avifauna. Alternatively, with extensive habitat restoration and management, we could avoid paying the extinction debt.

Hornero	26	1		45-53	2011	2011							Human activity is causing considerable changes on our planet, which entail misbalances in one of the systems that regulate animal population dynamics: the host-parasite relationship. In this article we show, using documented examples, the direct action of pollution, habitat fragmentation and climate change, as well as their interactions, on the health of wildlife populations and their pathogens. We present the case of myiasis caused by flies of the genus Philornis, which larvae show parasitic behaviour that affects bird nestlings. The occurrence of these parasites depends on climatic variables, being more abundant during periods of high precipitation and temperature, which is influenced by climate change. Their abundance is also related to nest density, which is affected by forest fragmentation. Therefore, the net effect of global environmental change on the impact of this parasitism depends on at least two of their interacting factors: climate change and deforestation.

Yong, Ding Li; Qie, Lan; Sodhi, Navjot S.; Koh, Lian Pin; Peh, Kelvin S.-H.; Lee, Tien Ming; Lim, Haw Chuan; Lim, Susan L.-H.				Journal of Tropical Ecology	27	1		1-14	January 2011	2011							To assess the impact of habitat fragmentation on tropical avian communities, we sampled lowland forest birds on six land-bridge islands and two mainland forest sites in Lake Kenyir, Peninsular Malaysia using timed point counts, hypothesizing that insectivorous birds are the worst affected guild. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the effects of area, isolation, primary dietary guild (omnivore, frugivore and insectivore) and their interactions in predicting species richness, abundance and diversity. Our analysis showed that a model that considered the effects of area, dietary guild and their interaction best explained observed patterns of species richness. But a model considering both area and dietary guild best explained the variation in abundance. Notably, insectivorous birds were singled out as the dietary guild most sensitive to fragmentation, followed by frugivorous and omnivorous birds and hence provide support for our hypothesis. Assemblages of insectivorous birds were clearly depauperate on anthropogenic forest islands in Lake Kenyir and are consistent with forest fragmentation studies in the Neotropics. Given their specialized foraging ecology and diversity, conservation of intact communities of insectivorous bird guilds in Malaysia will be critical for maintaining predator-prey interactions in lowland tropical forests.

Magrach, Ainhoa; Larrinaga, Asier R.; Santamaria, Luis				PLoS ONE	6	6		e21596, 1-11	2011	2011	http://ukpmc.ac.uk/issues/117633/						One and a half centuries after Darwin visited Chiloe Island, what he described as ''...an island covered by one great forest...'' has lost two-thirds of its forested areas. At this biodiversity hotspot, forest surface is becoming increasingly fragmented due to unregulated logging, clearing for pastures and replacement by exotic tree plantations. Decrease in patch size, increased isolation and ''edge effects'' can influence the persistence of forest species in remnant fragments. We assessed how these variables affect local density for six forest birds, chosen to include the most important seed dispersers (four species) and bird pollinators (two species, one of which acts also as seed disperser), plus the most common insectivore (Aphrastura spinicauda). Based on cue-count point surveys (8 points per fragment), we estimated bird densities for each species in 22 forest fragments of varying size, shape, isolation and internal-habitat structure (e.g. tree size and epiphyte cover). Bird densities varied with fragment connectivity (three species) and shape (three species), but none of the species was significantly affected by patch size. Satellite image analyses revealed that, from 1985 to 2008, forested area decreased by 8.8% and the remaining forest fragments became 16% smaller, 58[long dash]73% more isolated and 11[long dash]50% more regular. During that period, bird density estimates for the northern part of Chiloe' (covering an area of 1214.75 km2) decreased for one species (elaenia), increased for another two (chucao and hummingbird) and did not vary for three (rayadito, thrust and blackbird). For the first three species, changes in patch features respectively exacerbated, balanced and overcame the effects of forest loss on bird population size (landscape-level abundance). Hence, changes in patch features can modulate the effect of habitat fragmentation on forest birds, suggesting that spatial planning (guided by spatially-explicit models) can be an effective tool to facilitate their conservation.

Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club	130	4		266-272	December 2010	2010							Boat-billed Tody-Tyrant Hemitriccus josephinae occurs in north-east South America, but there are large gaps in its distribution and we know little of its natural history. We discovered a small population of H. josephinae at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragmentation Project (BDFFP), 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil, a range extension of 60 km. In 2007-09, we located five territories at the BDFFP. The species foraged in disturbed areas within mature forest by hopping sideways along small horizontal branches in the subcanopy and by upward-strikes or aerially hawking for insects. We described four vocalisations, two of which have not been previously described. Home range size is between 4.6 ha (minimum convex polygon method) and 5.7 ha (95% kernel density estimate). We provide one of the first ecological descriptions of an Amazonian Hemitriccus and comparisons against closely related species should be conducted to understand the complicated phylogenetic relationships of this group.								0007-1595								ZOOREC:ZOOR14705035316					J	ZOOR14708060491		Diet and Prey Availability of Terrestrial Insectivorous Birds Prone to Extinction in Amazonian Forest Fragments.		Mestre, Luiz Augusto Macedo; Cohn-Haft, Mario; Dias, Manoel Martins				Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology	53	6		1371-1381	Nov-Dec 2010	2010							This study compared niche breath, prey size, and diet variability in two pairs of sympatric species of terrestrial insectivorous birds, each pair containing one species that can persist in small forest fragments and one that does not. The pairs were Myrmeciza ferruginea and Sclerurus rufigularis; and Formicarius colma and F. analis, respectively. The prey availability in forest fragments was also sampled and compared to the availability in continuous forests. Niche breath indices did not differ between pair members, but diet variability differed in the opposite direction from that hypothesized. Although the two bird species most vulnerable to fragmentation fed on larger prey than less vulnerable species, prey availability, including that based on prey size did not differ among fragmented versus continuous forest sites. Thus, diet per se appeared not to be an important cause of extinctionproneness in these species. The simplest explanation proposed, that vulnerability to fragmentation was directly related to territory size, requires testing. However, it was consistent with observations that the bird species feeding on larger prey also need larger territories.

Kennedy, Christina M.; Marra, Peter P.; Fagan, William F.; Neel, Maile C.				Ecological Monographs	80	4		651-669	Nov 2010	2010							Land cover and land use surrounding, fragmented habitat can greatly impact species persistence by altering resource availability, edge effects, or the movement of individuals throughout a landscape. Despite the potential importance of the landscape matrix, ecologists still have limited understanding of the relative effects of different types of land cover and land uses on species patterns and processes in natural systems. Here we investigated whether Neotropical resident bird communities in limestone forest patches differed if they were embedded in three different human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, pert-urban development, and bauxite mining) relative to sites in continuous forest in central Jamaica. We found that species richness, community composition, and abundances were matrix-dependent, with agricultural landscapes supporting greater avian diversity and more intact community assemblages than either pen-urban or bauxite landscapes. Abundance of almost 70% of species differed in forest embedded in the different landscape matrix types. Traits related to resource use best predicted species responses, including diet guild, nest height, habitat association, and foraging strata. Insectivores, frugivores, canopy nesters, understory and canopy foragers, and forest-restricted species rarely observed in matrix habitats had lower abundances in forest fragments embedded in human-dominated matrix types than in continuous forest. In contrast, nectarivores, omnivores, granivores, ground and multi-strata nesters, ground foragers, and species regularly in matrix habitats were least sensitive to forest fragmentation. Results suggest that structure, composition, and land use disturbance regimes in matrix areas impact overall habitat quality in landscapes by potentially mediating resource availability inside as well as outside forest habitat. This study reinforces the importance of differentiating among land cover and land uses in fragmentation research and lends support to the hypothesis that resource availability may be a primary factor driving Neotropical bird responses to fragmentation.

Newmark, W.D.; Mkongewa, V.J.; Sobek, A.D.				Animal Conservation	13	5		474-482	October 2010	2010							Understanding the ranging behavior and habitat selection of understory tropical birds is important for corridor design and enhancing functional connectivity in fragmented tropical landscapes. Here we report on the ranging behavior and habitat selection of three terrestrial insectivorous bird species, the spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Usambara thrush Turdus roehli and orange ground thrush Zoothera gurneyi, in the East (EUM) and West (WUM) Usambara Mountains in north-east Tanzania. Based on 5945 locations and 3676 bird radio-tracking hours conducted between 2001 and 2008 at four study sites in the EUM and WUM, we determined that the 95% kernel home range and 50% kernel core range for the spot-throat, Usambara thrush, and orange ground thrush are similar yet large (aggregate mean home range=10.3[plus or minus]1.1 ha; aggregate mean core range 1.5[plus or minus]0.4 ha); that these species are adverse to crossing non-forested openings [long dash] no bird was recorded over the course of the study to cross a non-forested opening >15 m; and that the most extinction-prone species in our study system, the spot-throat and Usambara thrush, preferentially used slightly disturbed and primary forest, respectively. These results indicate that maintaining continuous forest cover and minimizing forest disturbance in corridors in the Eastern Arc Mountains is important for enhancing their habitat suitability for these species.			marcos, filipa/G-7133-2011					1367-9430; 1469-1795								ZOOREC:ZOOR14703021683					J	ZOOR14701007058		Forest patch size and isolation as drivers of bird species richness in Maputaland, Mozambique.

Journal of Biogeography	37	10		1884-1893	Oct 2010	2010							Aim To examine the response of forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages and feeding guilds to patch characteristics of forest fragments in the context of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in an area that supports high levels of species diversity and endemism. Location Dune, riverine, sand and swamp forest fragments in southern Mozambique's Maputaland. Methods We recorded 20 forest-dependent and 69 generalist bird species at 220 survey points in 30 forest fragments that ranged in size from 5 to 7432 ha and that were 100 to 5100 m apart. We used linear regressions to relate the number of species to forest fragment size, isolation, perimeter, fractal dimension, shape and core area for frugivores, insectivores, granivores, nectarivores, carnivores and omnivores separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages. We tested for modality in occupancy frequency distributions of species in forest fragments and used the binary matrix temperature calculator to determine whether the assemblages had a nested structure separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird species. Results The number of forest-dependent and generalist bird species categorized into the feeding guilds varied independently from forest patch parameter values. Occupancy models showed a random distribution for forest-dependent birds, and generalists had a unimodal distribution. Both the forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages had a non-nested structure. The presence of eight rare forest-dependent and four endemic bird species in 22 of the 30 fragments contributed to the non-nested structure of these bird assemblages. Main conclusions Fragmented forests did not induce the expected responses of the forest bird assemblages in that the number of species was not explained by patch characteristics, nor could we find evidence for metapopulation dynamics. Non-nestedness may be caused by the few rare and endemic species occupying forest fragments with a wide range of patch characteristics. Knowledge of the response of species to forest fragmentation can benefit conservation planning catering for rare and endemic species. Our study suggests that all forest fragments in the region may have to be included in a conservation network to complement existing landscape-based plans to protect the region.

Carpaneto, Giuseppe Maria; Mazziotta, Adriano; Coletti, Giorgia; Luiselli, Luca; Audisio, Paolo				Journal of Insect Conservation	14	5		555-565	Oct 2010	2010							Urban parks can harbour small populations of saproxylic insects of high conservation concern, such as Osmoderma eremita and other rare beetles. These areas often host old trees which have become very uncommon in rural areas where they are threatened by commercial forestry management procedures based on frequent tree cutting. Nevertheless, old trees of urban parks may represent a hazard for public safety and are sometimes cut by management authorities. The aim of this work was to assess the loss of reproductive sites for saproxylic beetles of the Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae and Cerambycidae, when felling plans are adopted according to a Visual Tree Assessment Procedure (VTA), in a Mediterranean urban park. On July-August 2004, 1,247 holm oaks were surveyed within the border of an urban park of Rome (Villa Borghese). The occurrence of saproxylic beetles (i.e. the presence of frass, living insects or their remains) was verified in 66 old holm oaks, 41% of which were doomed to cutting by VTA. Eleven of these trees (41% of the trees doomed to be cut) held fragments of adults and sometimes living larvae of Osmoderma eremita, and four of them (36%) were included in the felling plan. The presence of Osmoderma eremita in tree holes was more frequent in deep cavities. The presence of frass in the cavities was positively associated with tree height and a high degree of damage at the root collar and negatively with the presence of hole-nesting birds.

Iwasaki, Jay M.				Bios (Florence)	81	3-4		108-113	Sep 2010	2010							Habitat loss is the leading cause of wildlife decline worldwide. More prevalent than outright destruction, however, is habitat fragmentation, exhibited especially in tropical regions. Less well studied is the effect of these patchworks of habitats, and the subsequent effect on local invertebrate populations. A small-scale study assessing moth diversity and abundance between forest edges and crop interiors on a shade coffee plantation was conducted in western Jamaica in January 2009. Ornithologists use shade coffee as an example of sustainable agriculture that protects neotropical migratory birds, and shade coffee plantations have been shown to act as a buffer area ("halo") between fragmented habitats for insects. The patches of vegetation allow moths to disperse between areas without suitable vegetation for host plants. UV black light traps were used at the edge and interior of each site to sample local moth fauna. While there was no significant difference in morphospecies richness or abundance, there was a difference in diversity between sites, with very low overlap. The lack of significance suggests coffee habitat may act as a buffer between less disturbed forest and more disturbed human altered areas, but that some species may be restricted to certain habitats. Many moth species are host specific, and can serve as useful indicators for ecosystem and vegetative health and relative abundances. Studies of insects are important because of this group's extreme species diversity, and further research is necessary for assessing alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in rapidly disappearing forests in Jamaica and across the world's tropical regions.								0005-3155								ZOOREC:ZOOR14706045942					J	ZOOR14803022813		Avifauna in forest fragments of the Atlantic Rainforest in the south of Espirito Santo state, Brazil.	Avifauna em fragmentos lorestais da Mata Atlantica no sul do Espirito Santo.	Rossano Dario, Fabio				Biotemas	23	3		105-115	Setembro 2010	2010	http://www.biotemas.ufsc.br/volumes/v23n3.htm						This study was carried out in forest fragments located in the Atlantic Rainforest, in the town of Anchieta, south of Espirito Santo State, Brazil (located at latitude 20[degree]40[minute]S to 20[degree]48[minute]S, longitude 40[degree]34[minute]W to 40[degree]42[minute]W), along the seasons of 2008. The main objective of the study was to analyze the groups of birds that were affected by the forest fragmentation and the degree of isolation of these areas. The method used to register the avifauna specimens was the technique of observation per ixed point. Thus, the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'=4.18) was calculated, showing a significant abundance in the studied areas, and Equitability (E=0.81), suggesting that the number of species registered at the site represented the maximum capacity the areas were able to shelter. The Index of Point Abundance (IPA) was also calculated for each species. The IPA varied from 0.0042 (one contact) to 0.9500 (228 contacts), with a large number of species with low IPA and a few species with intermediate or high IPA. Taking into account 80 hours of observations, it was possible to register a total of 168 species of birds, distributed over a range of 45 families, 20 orders, and grouped in eight trophic guilds. Omnivores and insectivores were the most abundant, with 58 and 52 species respectively. The species most affected by the forest fragmentation were the great frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds.								0103-1643; 2175-7925								ZOOREC:ZOOR14803022813					J	ZOOR14702012252		What can tree plantations do for forest birds in fragmented forest landscapes? A case study in southern Brazil.		Volpato, Graziele Hernandes; Prado, Vitor Miranda; dos Anjos, Luiz				Forest Ecology and Management	260	7		1156-1163	Aug 31 2010	2010							Despite the fact that tree plantations are not able to completely replace the ecological function of natural forests, the present study proposes to evaluate for which bird species or avian groups tree plantations act as habitat in fragmented landscape in southern Brazil. We compared the richness and abundance of bird species in a natural forest to adjacent plantations of Araucaria, a native tree species and of pine, an exotic plant in South America. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of tree plantations on richness of avian groups with different levels of dependence on forest habitat, feeding habits and foraging strata as well as on threatened species. The fixed 100 m radius point-counts method was used. A total of 114 bird species were recorded in all areas. Of those, 93 occurred in natural forest, 87 in Araucaria plantations and 81 in pine plantations. These results indicate that richness and abundance were lower in the pine plantations than in the natural forest and in the Araucaria plantations. Araucaria plantations can be used by a high number of bird species and their richness was not significantly lower than that observed in the adjacent natural forest. Our results suggest that Araucaria plantations could act as habitat for a large number of bird species, especially for forest-dependents species, insectivores, frugivores and species at different threat categories.

Ruiz-Gutierrez, Viviana; Zipkin, Elise F.; Dhondt, Andre A.				Journal of Applied Ecology	47	3		621-630	Jun 2010	2010							1. Worldwide loss of biodiversity necessitates a clear understanding of the factors driving population declines as well as informed predictions about which species and populations are at greatest risk. The biggest threat to the long-term persistence of populations is the reduction and changes in configuration of their natural habitat. 2. Inconsistencies have been noted in the responses of populations to the combined effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. These have been widely attributed to the effects of the matrix habitats in which remnant focal habitats are typically embedded. 3. We quantified the potential effects of the inter-patch matrix by estimating occupancy and colonization of forest and surrounding non-forest matrix (NF). We estimated species-specific parameters using a dynamic, multi-species hierarchical model on a bird community in southwestern Costa Rica. 4. Overall, we found higher probabilities of occupancy and colonization of forest relative to the NF across bird species, including those previously categorized as open habitat generalists not needing forest to persist. Forest dependency was a poor predictor of occupancy dynamics in our study region, largely predicting occupancy and colonization of only non-forest habitats. 5. Our results indicate that the protection of remnant forest habitats is key for the long-term persistence of all members of the bird community in this fragmented landscape, including species typically associated with open, non-forest habitats. 6.Synthesis and applications. We identified 39 bird species of conservation concern defined by having high estimates of forest occupancy, and low estimates of occupancy and colonization of non-forest. These species survive in forest but are unlikely to venture out into open, non-forested habitats, therefore, they are vulnerable to the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Our hierarchical community-level model can be used to estimate species-specific occupancy dynamics for focal and inter-patch matrix habitats to identify which species within a community are likely to be impacted most by habitat loss and fragmentation. This model can be applied to other taxa (i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects) to estimate species and community occurrence dynamics in response to current environmental conditions and to make predictions in response to future changes in habitat configurations.

Manica, L.T.; Telles, M.; Dias, M.M.				Brazilian Journal of Biology	70	2		243-254	May 2010	2010							Bird species richness is an important measure for monitoring biodiversity changes. We analysed avifauna richness and composition in a 472 ha protected cerrado fragment and surroundings at Fazenda Canchim (RL-CPPSE). Sao Carlos, in the State of Sao Paulo (SP). We carried out 95.1 hours of observation (22 visits) at irregular intervals from May 2004 to December 2006. Qualitative surveys were done walking through tracks inside the fragment and on the roads at its edge. We recorded 160 species, six of which were endemic to Cerrado domain. 22 migratory. seven threatened within the State of Silo Paulo, and two globally threatened. We found 28 species in the cerrado. 110 in the cerrado sensu strict, 13 in the gallery forest. 26 in the reservoir border. 26 in pasturelands and sugar cane monoculture and 55 in an anthropic area. Most of the species had low frequency of occurrence in all vegetation forms. Insectivores were the major trophic category (46.9%). which is typical in tropical regions, and it is also related to resource availability. Omnivores followed with 19.4%. granivores with 8.8% and frugivores with 7.5%. We conclude that, despite its size and conservation status, our study area has a remarkable bird community and must he considered as a priority conservation area to preserve bird species in Sao Paulo State.

Moradi, Hossein Varasteh; Zakaria, Mohammed; Mohd, Abdullah B.; Yusof, Ebil				International Journal of Zoological Research	6	2		131-145	April-June 2010	2010							The study objectives were to test: (1) the effects of the edge-interior gradient on under storey insectivorous bird abundance, density and diversity; (2) effects of environmental variables along an edge-interior gradient at population level (i.e., on each sub-guilds and species abundance); (3) possible effects of environmental structure along an edge-interior gradient at community level (i.e., species richness, diversity and total abundance). Fifteen hundred and four birds belonging to 49 species were recorded. Species composition differed along the edge-interior gradient at the guild and species level. The composition of insectivorous birds was correlated with the latter measured environmental variables. Based on bird-habitat associations along the edge-interior gradient, two groups were distinguished. Arboreal foliage gleaning insectivores were positively correlated with ground cover, light intensity, shrub cover and percent of shrub cover between 0.5 and 2 m high. While terrestrial insectivores, were sensitive to the forest edge and could indicate the quality of forest interior habitats associated with high humidity, dense canopy cover and deep litter depth. Forest remnants in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia that have a deep leaf litter layer, a dense canopy cover and high relative humidity are able to support insectivorous species that are sensitive to edge effects. As such these forests have important conservation value.								1811-9778; 1811-9786								ZOOREC:ZOOR14611075515					J	ZOOR14608050913		Comparing bird community responses to forest fragmentation in two lowland Central American reserves.		Sigel, Bryan J.; Robinson, W. Douglas; Sherry, Thomas W.				Biological Conservation	143	2		340-350	Feb 2010	2010							Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce diversity of tropical bird communities, but the predictability of how communities in fragments disintegrate over time remains unclear. We compared bird community changes of two lowland forest reserves, La Selva Biological Station (LSBS), Costa Rica and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, both approximately the same size (1500 ha) and at similar latitude (9-10 N) in Central America. Both reserves are losing bird species despite LSBS's connection to an existing large park (incomplete isolation) and BCI's favorable location within a largely forested landscape. We examined characteristics of guilds and species lost from the sites to determine whether patterns were similar, and thus predictable. Some of the same guilds declined at both reserves, particularly insectivores and ground/understory nesters. At LSBS mixed-species flock participants, forest species, and burrow-nesters also declined or became extirpated disproportionately. At BCI edge species became extirpated. Body mass was a poor predictor of species and guild loss at both sites, except for carnivores at La Selva. Thus, fragmentation appears to influence some guilds more than others, but which species decline or disappear in tropical forest fragments is also influenced by site-specific factors, mostly yet to be determined. We need to understand such idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation better, rather than rely on one-size-fits-all management plans to conserve bird communities in tropical forest fragments.

Dieta de aves da mata Atlantica: uma abordagem baseada em conteudos estomacais.

Knowledge on the remaining avifauna in this region is scarce, especially about trophic guilds that can help measure the vulnerability of these species in relation to the processes of habitats fragmentation and degradation. The aim of this study was to identify the food items which are consumed by the guilds of birds of this region and to evaluate the diet of some endemic species of this biome. The study was conducted by analyzing stomach contents (alcool-preserved) of voucher specimens deposited in the Ornithological Collection of the Zoology Department of the Federal University from Minas Gerais. From 98 bird species and 25 families we evaluated the stomach contents of 219 individuals. In the diet remainings 18 different food items were identified, most abundantly seeds and insects of the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. The indicator species analysis showed that only Coleoptera and Hemiptera were indicators of the diet of insectivorous birds, while in omnivores plant remainings were predominant. Twenty-one endemic species which consumed 14 different food items were also included in the study. Considering the limited literature regarding the diet of the endemic species of Atlantic forest, the results contribute to a better knowledge about the diet of these species. The data summarized in this study show some of the food characteristics of various bird species which may serve as a basis for further research, conservation strategies, and future plans for managing the indigenous avifauna of the Atlantic forest.

Armleder, Harold; Waterhouse, Michaela				British Columbia Journal of Ecosystems and Management	9	3		102-105	Winter 2009	2009	http://www.forrex.org/jem/default.asp						The purpose of the Itcha-Ilgachuz Research Project is to develop and test silvicultural systems that maintain caribou habitat, including terrestrial and arboreal forage lichens, while extracting timber. To develop a viable silvicultural system we are also researching regeneration (planted and natural), breeding birds, microclimate, long-term site productivity, treefall, and growth and yield. We are also addressing the implications of high tree mortality, caused by mountain pine beetle (mpb), to caribou and other values. The current attack on the Chilcotin Plateau is causing much higher stand mortality than that experienced in the 1980s and a larger proportion of the landscape is affected. Irregular group shelterwood and group selection have been tested for over 10 years and results indicate these are viable silvicultural systems. With the arrival of mpb they remain a key part of the management approach. These systems have the potential to maintain habitat because: (1) the stand, even with mostly dead trees, still provides partial shade for lichens for about 20 years; (2) this gives regeneration a chance to grow for 20 years to provide future partial shade for lichens; (3) mobility is not an issue with 50% of the trees harvested; and (4) the standing dead trees provide a source of arboreal lichen fragments for the regenerating openings. Ongoing measurements will determine whether these initial indications are correct.								1488-4666								ZOOREC:ZOOR14509057066					J	ZOOR14605033065		Increased avian insectivory in a fragmented temperated forest.		Lluch, A.; Gonzalez-Gomez, P.L.; de la Vega, X.; Simonetti, J.A.				Community Ecology	10	2		206-208	December 2009	2009							Habitat fragmentation increases the temporal variability in species richness and abundance of forest birds. Therefore, changes in the ecological interactions at which birds are engaged might be transient. Furthermore, despite changes in insectivory rates might have cascading effects if such changes are permanent, there are no evaluations of the persistency of changes in insectivory rates. In this study, we assessed the persistency of changes in insectivory in forest fragments, comparing the intensity of insectivory upon artificial insect larvae at three different years at a single site in central Chile. In coastal Maulino forest, the intensity of insectivory is persistently higher in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. An increase in insectivory might reduce herbivorous insect abundance which is translated into higher growth rates in seedlings at forest fragments, a factor that is changing forest dynamics. Our study suggests that the variation in bird insectivory on fragmented forest is a permanent phenomenon, which might have profound implication for the dynamics of the forest remnants.

Faria, Christiana M.A.; Rodrigues, Marcos				Journal of Field Ornithology	80	4		328-335	December 2009	2009							Little is known about the birds associated with army-ant swarms in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Our objectives were to locate and monitor army-ant swarms in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil and to identify the species of birds that attended the swarms and exhibited bivouac-checking behavior. From July 2004 to August 2005, we located 49 swarms of army ants, including 28 Eciton burchelli, 19 Labidus praedator, and 2 Eciton vagans swarms. No birds were present at 17 (35%) swarms. At 32 swarms where birds were present, 22 (69%) were E. burchelli swarms and 10 (31%) were L. praedator swarms. No birds were observed at the two E. vagans swarms. We identified 66 species of birds attending the swarms, but only 43 species were observed foraging on prey flushed by the ants. Eighteen of these species had not been previously reported to forage in association with army-ant swarms. Most birds observed during our study attended army-ant swarms opportunistically, with White-shouldered Fire-eyes (Pyriglena leucoptera) the only obligate ant follower. Our observations suggest that the arthropods and other organisms flushed by army ants represent an important food resource for several species of birds in the Atlantic forest ecosystem.

Peters, Marcell K.; Okalo, Benjamin				Biological Conservation	142	10		2050-2058	October 2009	2009							Tropical rainforests are disappearing at a rapid rate. Although several studies have revealed the detrimental effects of forest fragmentation on tropical birds, the ecological mechanisms facilitating the decline of populations have been poorly documented. In the tropical rainforests of Africa and America, ant-following birds track the massive swarm raids of army ants and prey on animals which are flushed by the ants. We analyzed the persistence of five species of ant-following birds along a habitat fragmentation gradient in western Kenya and tested if bird populations are limited by the abundance of army ant colonies in forests. Abundances of four of five ant-followers declined by 52[long dash]100% in forest fragments [much less than]113 ha. Multi-model Bayesian inference suggests that the decline of the three most specialized ant-followers is facilitated by a decrease in the abundance of the army ant Dorylus wilverthi in small forest fragments. Our data suggests that a second, fragmentation-tolerant army ant species, Dorylus molestus, does not functionally compensate for the decline of D. wilverthi because, first, of a higher affinity of birds to D. wilverthi raids (found for one species). Second, because the daytime activity of D. molestus is dependent on high humidity conditions, a pattern which was not found for D. wilverthi. Consequently, specialized ant-followers in small fragments, where D. wilverthi is missing, probably suffer from food scarcity due to a cease of army ant foraging in the dry season. Our results suggest that a subtle alteration of army ant communities caused by habitat fragmentation may have large ecological consequences.

Larsen, T.B.; Aduse-Poku, K.; Safian, Sz.				African Entomology	17	2		131-146	September 2009	2009							The butterfly fauna of the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana is reviewed in detail. The Sanctuary covers just 1.9 km2 but only parts are truly forested. It is situated in the extreme north of the original forest zone and is Currently isolated from any larger forests by some 50 km of derived savanna and farmbush. It has survived only because it provides the essential habitat for two species of monkey that are revered by the local communities. Surveys indicate that the present butterfly fauna is about 375 species, which is impressive for a tiny forest in far from pristine condition. Comparison with other forests in Ghana indicates that it would have contained about 500 species when it was part of a larger, contiguous forest system. It would thus seem that the small size and increasing isolation has so far led to a loss of no more than 125 species (25 % of its original fauna), which includes most of the endemic and rarer species in the country A larger number of butterflies appears to Survive in small forest fragments than is the case with birds. Continued monitoring would be interesting in its own right, but also because forest fragments are potentially important as stepping stories between the increasingly isolated major forests of Ghana.								1021-3589							10.4001/003.017.0203	ZOOREC:ZOOR14604026746					J	ZOOR14602008267		Seed dispersal distances and plant migration potential in tropical East Asia.		Corlett, Richard T.				Biotropica	41	5		592-598	September 2009	2009							Most predictions of vegetation responses to anthropogenic climate change over the next 100 yr are based on plant physiological tolerances and do not account for the ability of plant species to migrate over the distances required in the time available, or the impact of habitat fragmentation on this ability. This review assesses the maximum routine dispersal distances achievable in tropical East Asia and their vulnerability to human impacts. Estimates for various plant-vector combinations range from 10 m, for species dispersed by ants or mechanical means, to > 10 km for some species dispersed by wind (tiny seeds), water, fruit pigeons, large fruit bats (tiny seeds), elephants, rhinoceroses, and people. Most plant species probably have maximum dispersal distances in the 100-1000 m range, but the widespread, canopy-dominant Dipterocarpaceae and Fagaceae are normally dispersed 100 m. Large fruit bats and fruit pigeons are particularly important for long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes and should be protected from hunting. The maximum seed dispersal distances estimated in this study are potentially sufficient for many plant species to track temperature changes in steep topography, but are far too small for a significant role in mitigating climate change impacts in the lowlands, where temperature and rainfall gradients are much more shallow.

Packett, Diane L.; Dunning, John B., Jr				Auk	126	3		579-589	July 2009	2009							Limited stopover habitat along migration routes is a possible contributor to population declines in migratory landbirds. In highly fragmented agricultural landscapes, potential stopover sites are often limited to riparian corridor forests and small forest patches, but there are little quantitative data oil stopover habitat selection in these areas, especially with regard to how migrants use isolated versus connected, and riparian versus upland, habitat patches. We examined the use of upland forest woodlots ill the forest-agricultural landscape of northwest Indiana as stopover habitat, to determine whether migrants selected stopover sites on the basis of proximity to riparian corridor forest. In two spring and two fall seasons, we conducted 384 surveys in 12 small woodlots at three levels of isolation from a riparian forest corridor, detecting 3,695 ell-route migrants of 76 species. We detected no difference in migrant abundance or species richness among distance classes in either season, and a principal-component variable comprising several woodlot isolation metrics was not a significant contributor to migrant abundance in linear regression models. Fall migrant abundance was positively associated with early-successional forests containing fruiting trees and shrubs, whereas spring abundance was not associated with any vegetation characteristics. The lack of patterns of habitat occupancy at the landscape level suggests that migrants select stopover sites on the basis of local habitat characteristics such as food resources, regardless of the landscape context. Small, isolated woodlots composed largely of forest edge with high fruit and insect abundance may, therefore, be important conservation targets in highly fragmented landscapes where forest cover is limited.

Mazia, C. Noemi; Chaneton, Enrique J.; Kitzberger, Thomas; Garibaldi, Lucas A.				Austral Ecology	34	4		359-367	June 2009	2009							Predators are thought to play a key role in controlling herbivory, thus having positive indirect effects on plants. However, evidence for terrestrial trophic cascades is still fragmentary, perhaps due to variation in top-down forces created by environmental heterogeneity. We examined the magnitude of predation effects on foliar damage by chewing insects and mean leaf size, by excluding birds from saplings in 'dry' and 'wet' Nothofagus pumilio forests in the northern Patagonian Andes, Argentina. The experiment lasted 2 years, encompassing a severe drought during the La Nina phase of a strong El Nino/Southern Oscillation event, which was followed by unusually high background folivory levels. Insect damage was consistently higher in wet than in dry forest saplings. In the drought year (1999), bird exclusion increased folivory rates in both forests but did not affect tree leaf size. In the ensuing season (2000), leaf damage was generally twice as high as in the drought year. As a result, bird exclusion not only increased the extent of folivory but also significantly decreased sapling leaf size. The latter effect was stronger in the wet forest, suggesting compensation of leaf area loss by dry forest saplings. Overall, the magnitude of predator indirect effects depended on the response variable measured. Insectivorous birds were more effective at reducing folivory than at facilitating leaf area growth. Our results indicate that bird-initiated trophic cascades protect N. pumilio saplings from insect damage even during years with above-normal herbivory, and also support the view that large-scale climatic events influence the strength of trophic cascades.

These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, Suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. [copyright] 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Basler, Aparecida Brusamarello; Mueller, Eliara Solange; Petry, Maria Virginia				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	17	2		113-120	Junho 2009	2009							Myrsine coriacea, known as "capororoca", produces a large number of small, round fruits, with a thin pericarp and dark purple colours when ripe. The objective of the present study was to identify bird species using M. coriacea for the consumption of fruit and insects or for perching alone in the Aparados da Serra National Park (Brazil). Thirty-one bird species were recorded, among which 23 consumed fruits. The species of birds Tangara preciosa, Cyclarhis gujanensis, Leucochloris albicollis, and Zonotrichia capensis, the plant used only for landing and Colaptes campestris, Xiphorhyncus fuscus, Leptasthenura setari and Xenops rutilans used the plant to search for insects. Fragment area size and monthly variation did not affect the diversity of birds that visited the tree or the number of events recorded for each type of behaviour. The fruits of M. coriacea were largely consumed by birds and the seeds could have been potentially released by them, thus contributing to the maintenance and regeneration of fragments of tropical forest, in the PNAS.

Barbaro, Luc; van Halder, Inge				Ecography	32	2		321-333	April 2009	2009							The goal of the present study is to assess how landscape configuration influenced the distribution of life-history traits across bird, carabid beetle and butterfly communities of mosaic forest landscapes in south-western France. A set of 12 traits was selected for each species, characterizing rarity, biogeographical distribution, body size, trophic guild, dispersal power, reproductive potential and phenology. We used a three-table ordination method, RLQ analysis, to link directly bird, beetle and butterfly traits to the same set of landscape metrics calculated in 400 m-radius buffers around sample points. RLQ analyses showed significant associations between life-history traits and landscape configuration for all three taxonomical groups. Threatened species from all groups were characterized by a combination of life traits that makes them especially sensitive to the fragmentation of herbaceous and shrub-dominated habitats at the landscape scale. These key life traits were low productivity, intermediate body mass, restricted geographic range, late phenology and ground gleaning for threatened birds, intermediate body size, spring adult activity, northern distribution and summer breeding period for threatened carabids, and restricted range, overwintering as eggs or larvae, low mobility, monophagy and short flight periods for threatened butterflies. Focusing on species life traits can provide a functional perspective, which helps to determine adequate measures for the conservation of threatened species and communities of several taxonomical groups in mosaic landscapes.								0906-7590							10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05546.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14511067941					J	ZOOR14510061587		Using focal species modelling to evaluate the impact of land use change on forest and other habitat networks in western oceanic landscapes.		Humphrey, Jonathan; Ray, Duncan; Brown, Tracy; Stone, Duncan; Watts, Kevin; Anderson, Russell				Forestry (Oxford)	82	2		119-134	April 2009	2009							Habitat networks have an important role in combating the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. This paper demonstrates how focal species modelling can be used to help predict the effects of land use change on habitat networks in western oceanic landscapes. The modelling was applied to the Isle of Mull in Western Scotland using three focal species: Pseudocyphellaria norvegica (Gyeln.) P. James, a lichen of native broadleaved woodland; marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia Rottemburg), a butterfly of damp grassland and song thrush (Turdus philomelos CL Brehm), an avian habitat generalist. Significant areas of planted conifer forest on Mull will be converted to open ground habitat and native woodland. These land use changes, together with modest expansion of native woodland, are predicted to have a positive impact on networks for the lichen and marsh fritillary without unduly compromising networks for habitat generalists. There may be scope therefore for a more ambitious strategy for developing native woodland and damp grassland networks, but further testing using focal species with more exacting ecological requirements is desirable. Focal species modelling has value in informing strategies for land use change and the development of habitat networks provided that care is taken to select species with relevant ecological requirements.								0015-752X							10.1093/forestry/cpn042	ZOOREC:ZOOR14510061587					J	ZOOR14506037013		Gap-crossing movements predict species occupancy in Amazonian forest fragments.		Lees, Alexander C.; Peres, Carlos A.				Oikos	118	2		280-290	February 2009	2009							In fragmented landscapes, species persistence within isolated habitat patches is governed by a myriad of species life-history, habitat patch and landscape characteristics. We investigated the inter-specific variation in non-forest gap-crossing abilities of an entire tropical forest-dependent avifauna. We then related this measure of dispersal ability to species life-history characteristics and occupancy data from 31 variable-sized forest patches sampled within the same fragmented forest landscape. A total of 5436 gap-crossing movements of 231 forest-dependent bird species were observed across ten linear forest gaps of varying widths, adjacent to large areas of undisturbed forest. Species persistence in isolated fragments was strongly linked to gap-crossing ability. The most capable gap-crossers were medium to large-bodied species in the large insectivore, frugivore and granivore guilds, matching the most prevalent subset of species in small forest patches. However, some competent gap-crossing species failed to occur in small patches, and minimum forest-patch area requirements were more important in determining patch occupancy for these species. Narrow forest gaps (4-70 m) created by roads and power-lines may become territory boundaries, thereby eliminating home-range gap-crossing movements for many forest species, but permit rarer dispersal events. Wider gaps (>70 m) may inhibit gap-crossing behaviour for all but the most vagile species. Although patch size and quality may be the most important factors in structuring species assemblages in forest fragments, our results show that the degree of patch isolation and permeability of the surrounding matrix also explain which species can persist in forest isolates. Reducing the number and width of forest-dividing gaps; maintaining and/or creating forest corridors and increasing matrix permeability through the creation and maintenance of 'stepping-stone' structures will maximise the species retention in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.

Casey, Jordan M.; Wilson, Marie E.; Hollingshead, Nicholas; Haskell, David G.				International Journal of Ecology	2009		(Article ID 539417)	1-10	2009	2009	http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijeco/2009/539417.pdf						To investigate the potential causes of changes to bird communities in exurban areas, we examined the relationship between bird and macroinvertebrate communities in exurbanized forest.We randomly located sampling points across a gradient of exurbanization. We used point counts to quantify bird communities and sweep netting, soil cores, pitfalls, and frass collectors to quantify macroinvertebrates. Bird communities had higher richness and abundance in exurban areas compared to undeveloped forests, and lost some species of conservation concern but gained others. The macroinvertebrate community was slightly more abundant in exurban areas, with a slight shift in taxonomic composition. The abundance ofmacroinvertebrates in soil cores (but not pitfalls) predicted the abundance of ground-foraging birds. The abundance of macroinvertebrates in sweep nets was not associated with the abundance of aerial insectivore birds. Exurbanization therefore appears to change bird and macroinvertebrate communities, but to a lesser extent than agricultural forest fragmentation or intensive urbanization.								1687-9708; 1687-9716								ZOOREC:ZOOR14608054963					J	ZOOR14603018970		Interspecific competition and conservation management of continuous subtropical woodlands.		Howes, Alison L.; Maron, Martine				Wildlife Research	36	7		617-626	2009	2009							Context. Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner. Aims. We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands. Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables. Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wild. re and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance. Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modi. cation of. re regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer. Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes.

Climate change has been inducing range shifts for many species as they follow their suitable climate space and further shifts are projected. Whether species will be able to colonize regions where climate conditions become suitable, so-called 'new climate space', depends on species traits and habitat fragmentation. 2. By combining bioclimate envelope models with dispersal models, we identified areas where the spatial cohesion of the ecosystem pattern is expected to be insufficient to allow colonization of new climate space. 3. For each of three ecosystem types, three species were selected that showed a shift in suitable climate space and differed in habitat fragmentation sensitivity. 4. For the 2020 and 2050 time slices, the amount of climatically suitable habitat in northwest Europe diminished for all studied species. Additionally, significant portions of new suitable habitat could not be colonized because of isolation. Together, this will result in a decline in the amount of suitable habitat protected in Natura 2000 sites. 5. We develop several adaptation strategies to combat this problem: (i) link isolated habitat that is within a new suitable climate zone to the nearest climate-proof network; (ii) increase colonizing capacity in the overlap zone, the part of a network that remains suitable in successive time frames; (iii) optimize sustainable networks in climate refugia, the part of a species' range where the climate remains stable. 6. Synthesis and applications. Following the method described in this study, we can identify those sites across Europe where ecosystem patterns are not cohesive enough to accommodate species' responses to climate change. The best locations for climate corridors where improving connectivity is most urgent and potential gain is highest can then be pinpointed.

Martensen, Alexandre C.; Pimentel, Rafael G.; Metzger, Jean Paul				Biological Conservation	141	9		2184-2192	September 2008	2008							It is known that large fragment sizes and high connectivity levels are key components for maintaining species in fragments; however, their relative effects are poorly understood, especially in tropical areas. In order to test these effects, we built models for explaining understory birds occurrence in a fragmented Atlantic Rain Forest landscape with intermediate habitat cover (3%). Data from over 9000 mist-net hours from 17 fragments differing in size (2-175 ha) and connectivity (considering corridor linkages and distance to nearby fragments) were ranked under a model selection approach. A total 1293 individuals of 62 species were recorded. Species richness, abundance and compositional variation were mainly affected by connectivity indices that consider the capacity of species to use corridors and/or to cross short distances up to 30 m through the matrix. Bird functional groups were differently affected by area and connectivity: while terrestrial insectivores, omnivores and frugivores were affected by both area and connectivity, the other groups (understory insectivores, nectarivores, and others) were affected only by connectivity. In the studied landscape, well connected fragments can sustain an elevated number of species and individuals. Connectivity gives the opportunity for individuals to use multiple fragments, reducing the influence of fragment size. While preserving large fragments is a conservation target worldwide and should continue to be, our results indicated that connectivity between fragments can enhance the area functionally connected and is beneficial to all functional groups and therefore should be a conservation priority.

Goijman, Andrea P.; Zaccagnini, Maria Elena				Hornero	23	2		67-76	Sept-Dec 2008	2008							Birds play several roles in agricultural lands and respond to habitat heterogeneity within the agricultural landscape. Agricultural intensification in Argentina has increased the sown area, mainly with soybean, fragmenting landscapes in the pampas and mesopotamic region. In Entre Ros Province, the original Espinal forest has been fragmented, leaving remnant patches of natural vegetation, in cases modified by cattle grazing. These changes represent a potential threat for avian conservation. In Entre Rios, terraces may be a useful habitat in maintaining avian diversity, similar to other non-cropped linear habitats in agricultural landscapes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity created by terraces would maintain higher species richness and densities of avian species that use original or modified forests within cropped areas compared to fields without terraces. The study was carried out in soybean fields with an adjacent forest and either herbaceous, shrub or no terraces in two periods (March-April 2004). Birds were surveyed using line transects in field interior and edge, and observations were carried out in one forest remnant adjoining each field. Most bird species recorded in soybean fields were insectivorous or consume invertebrates during the breeding season. Species richness, total bird density and the density of granivores, insectivores and omnivores were higher in fields with terraces than in fields without terraces. Moreover, shrub terraces had higher effect on species richness and bird density than herbaceous terraces. Our results suggest that terraces may serve as a possible tool for maintaining avian diversity in agroecosystems in Entre Rios.								0073-3407								ZOOREC:ZOOR14703020850					J	ZOOR14501003806		Natural history of the threatened bearded screech-owl (Megascops barbarus) in Chiapas, Mexico.		Enriquez, Paula L.; Cheng, Kimberly A.

The first nest recorded for this species was in a natural cavity of an old oak(Quercus laurina) and contained a single nestling. Four roosting sites were located, two in Clethra chiapensis (evergreen broadleaf) and two in Pinus ayacahuite (pine; mean height = 3.4 m). Fecal analysis indicated that diet was primarily insectivorous, consisting of Melononthidae (Coleoptera; 72.3%), along with a few Orthoptera (9.2%), Lepidoptera (3.1%), and Arachnida (1.5%). Data from 39 owls (24 captured and 15 skins) were used for morphology analysis. This species exhibited reversed sexual dimorphism, with females having greater mass and longer tails than males. Molting occured during the rainy season (July to October), with the primary and secondary feathers being molted simultaneously. Subcutaneous fat was moderate to abundant in the dry season only (December to May). Maximum longevity we recorded was at least 4.17 yr. These first natural history data for the species provides preliminary information for understanding the ecological requirements of the Bearded Screech-Owl in fragmented tropical montane forest.								0892-1016							10.3356/JRR-07-30.1	ZOOREC:ZOOR14501003806					J	ZOOR14501003658		Foraging ecology of High Andean insectivorous birds in remnant Polylepis forest patches.		Lloyd, Huw				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	120	3		531-544	September 2008	2008							I examined how High Andean insectivorous birds partition resources in remnant Polylepis forest patches at three locations in the Cordillera Vilcanota, Southern Peru. A number of distinctive guilds were identified within the bird community based on the manner and location of foraging displayed by each species. Important dimensions that enabled differentiation amongst guild co-members were those that supported the partitioning of resources between guilds. The significant disproportionate use of substrates and prey-attack maneuvers by birds indicated substrate specialization within the insectivorous Polylepis bird community. These specializations provide a means by which Polylepis insectivores fit syntopically along a resource gradient. Insectivores demonstrated a differential response to foraging in smaller patches, and change,; in the foraging regimes Of four guilds between large and small patches were frequent. The most abundant insectivores in small patches were the least diverse foragers; they compensated behaviorally for changes in patch habitat quality by using fewer substrates and prey-attack maneuvers. Guild members that shifted their foraging regime to use fewer attack maneuvers were also more tolerant of small patches. Small Polylepis patches have a significant role in fragmented High-Andean ecosystem functioning by providing essential foraging habitat for insectivorous birds.								1559-4491							10.1676/07-059.1	ZOOREC:ZOOR14501003658					J	ZOOR14412073046		The impact of Tropical Cyclone Larry on bird communities in fragments of the endangered rainforest type 5b.		Freeman, Amanda N.D.; Pias, Kyle; Vinson, Magdalena F.				Austral Ecology	33	4		532-540	June 2008	2008							Bird surveys were conducted to assess the impact of a severe cyclone on bird communities in three fragments of the endangered rainforest Type 5b on the Atherton Tablelands of far north Queensland. Bird communities were surveyed using timed area searches in three sites in each of the three fragments and were undertaken prior to and following Tropical Cyclone Larry. Cyclone Larry caused short-term changes in the abundance of some species of birds in Type 5b rainforest fragments. Two weeks after the storm, in two of three fragments surveyed, abundance of the frugivorous wompoo fruit-dove (Ptilinopus magnificus) and figbird (Sphecotheres viridis) had decreased while the omnivorous Macleay's honeyeater (Xanthotis macleayana) and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii) decreased in abundance in all three locations. Most insectivorous species increased in some sites and decreased in others following Cyclone Larry. Rapid recovery of bird communities to approximately their pre-cyclone state after only 7 months appeared to reflect the capacity of species to either modify their foraging behaviour, switch foods, or to move within or between fragments or to other food sources in the landscape.								1442-9985							10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01908.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14412073046					J	ZOOR14409052515		Effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation on flocks of African ant-following birds.		Peters, Marcell K.; Likare, Smith; Kraemer, Manfred				Ecological Applications	18	4		847-858	June 2008	2008							Tropical rain forests are rapidly cleared, fragmented, and degraded in sub-Saharan Africa; however, little is known about the response of species and even of key ecological groups to these processes. One of the most intriguing (but often neglected) ecological phenomena in African rain forests is the interaction between swarm-raiding army ants and ant-following birds. Similar to their well-known Neotropical representatives, ant-following birds in Africa track the massive swarm raids of army ants and feed on arthropods flushed by the ants. In this study we analyzed the effect of habitat fragmentation and degradation of a mid-altitude Congo-Guinean rain forest in western Kenya on the structure of ant-following bird flocks. Significant numbers of swarm raids were located in all forest fragments and in both undegraded and degraded forest. Fifty-six different species of birds followed army ant raids, forming bird flocks of one to 15 species. We quantitatively differentiated the bird community into five species of specialized ant-followers and 51 species of opportunistic ant-followers. Species richness and size of bird blocks decreased with decreasing size of forest fragments and was higher in undegraded than in degraded habitat. This was caused by the decrease of the species richness and number of specialized ant-followers at swarms, while the group of opportunistic ant-followers was affected little by habitat fragmentation and degradation. The composition of bird flocks was more variable in small fragments and degraded forest, compared to undegraded habitat in large fragments. The effect of habitat fragmentation on flock structure was best explained by the strong decline of the abundance of specialized ant-followers in small forest fragments. To conserve the association of army ants and ant-following birds in its natural state, vast areas of unfragmented and undegraded tropical rain forest are necessary.

Giraudo, Alejandro R.; Matteucci, Silvia D.; Alonso, Julian; Herrera, Justo; Abramson, Raul R.				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	5		1251-1265	May 2008	2008							The Atlantic Forest (AF) is one of the five most threatened and megadiverse world hotspots. It is arguably the most devastated and highly threatened ecosystem on the planet. The vast scope of habitat loss and extreme fragmentation in the AF hotspots has left intact very few extensive and continuous forested fragments. We compared bird assemblages between small (100 ha) and large (>6,000 ha) forest remnants, in one of the largest AF remnants in Argentina. We performed 84 point-counts of birds in four large fragments (LF) and 67 points in 25 small fragments (SF). We recorded 4,527 bird individuals belonging to 173 species; 2,632 belonging to 153 species in LF and 1,897 in 124 species in SF. Small fragments suffered a significant loss of bird richness, mainly forest dependent species, but the birds abundance did not decrease, due to an increase in abundance of forest independent and semi-dependent bird species (edge and non forest species) that benefit from forest fragmentation. The bird guilds of frugivores, undestory, terrestrial and midstory insectivores, nectarivores and raptors, and the endemic species of AF were area sensitive, decreasing significantly in richness and abundance in the SF. Terrestrial granivores were the only guild positively affected by forest fragmentation, containing mainly edge species, which forage in open areas or borders including crops. Our first observations on fragmentation effects on bird assemblages in the southernmost Argentinean Atlantic Forests did not validate the hypothesis on pre-adaptation to human disturbances in the bird communities of AF. On the contrary, we observed that forest dependent, endemic and several sensitive bird guilds were strongly affected by fragmentation, putting in evidence the vulnerability to the fragmentation process and the necessity to conserve large remnants to avoid reduction of the high biodiversity of AF birds.

Lees, A.C.; Peres, C.A.				Animal Conservation	11	2		128-137	April 2008	2008							The fact that species vary in their vulnerability to extinction is well documented, but the reasons for these differences remain poorly understood. Why should some species/families/guilds decline rapidly with increasing anthropogenic disturbance, while others either tolerate or proliferate in disturbed habitats? We investigated the bird species composition in 31 primary forest patches of varying size in a region of the Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' and assessed which species life-history traits predisposed individual species to extinction. Medium-sized non-flocking canopy frugivores/ominvores of low primary forest dependence were least likely to go extinct in small patches, while small-bodied flock-following primary-forest-dependent terrestrial insectivores were most fragmentation sensitive. We found highly idiosyncratic relationships between the minimum size of forest patches occupied by different species and their territory size requirements estimated based on other Amazonian studies. This suggests that avian assemblages in forest fragments primarily comprise species that either have good dispersal abilities or are highly tolerant to the non-forest matrix, rather than those whose minimum spatial requirements can be met by the size of available forest fragments.

Dunham, Amy E.				Oikos	117	4		571-579	April 2008	2008							Understanding the impact of losing trophic diversity has global significance for managing ecosystems as well as important theoretical implications for community and ecosystem ecology. In several tropical forest ecosystems, habitat fragmentation has resulted in declines and local extinctions of mammalian and avian terrestrial insectivores. To assess the ability of a tropical rainforest community in Ivory Coast to resist perturbation from such loss of trophic diversity, I traced feedbacks in above and below ground communities and measured changes in nutrient levels and herbivory rates in response to an experimental exclosure of avian and mammalian terrestrial insectivores. I present evidence that loss of this functional group may result in increased tree seedling herbivory and altered nutrient regimes through changes in the abundance and guild structure of invertebrates. Exclusion of top predators of the forest floor resulted in increased seedling herbivory rates and macro-invertebrate (>5 mm) densities with strongest effects on herbivorous taxa, spiders and earthworms. Densities of microbivores including Collembola, Acarina and Sciaridae showed the opposite trend as did levels of inorganic phosphorus in the soil. Results were evaluated using path analysis which supported the presence of a top down trophic cascade in the detrital web which ultimately affected turnover of phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in tropical soils. Results illustrate the potential importance of vertebrate predators in both above and belowground food webs despite the biotic diversity and structural heterogeneity of the rainforest floor.

Arcos, Inty T.; Jimenez, Francisco; Harvey, Celia A.; Casanoves, Fernando				Revista de Biologia Tropical	56	1		355-369	March 2008	2008							Riparian forests protect many species of plants and animals. We studied bird communities in riparian forest belts of the Sesesmiles river microwatershed, Copan, Honduras (140[degree] 43' 12" - 140[degree] 58'35" N, 88[degree] 53'23" - 89[degree] 14' 17" W). The main goal was to explore the effects of belt breadth on the richness and abundance of avian species visiting these forests. We selected 20 belts, and randomly established 30 observation points to monitor bird presence in the dry (March-April 2005) and rainy (June-July 2005) season (N = 60 observations). A total of 1 294 birds belonging to 145 species were recorded. Bird diversity was significantly correlated to the breadth of the riparian belts, with a greater number of species and individuals in belts 50 m wide or wider. Insectivorous and nectarivorous birds were the most abundant guilds. All bird species identified depend to some degree on riparian forests and are affected by belt breadth. Riparian belts over 50 m should be kept or established in order to conserve bird populations within agricultural and fragmented landscapes in similar tropical areas.

We summarize 7 months of data from radio tracking an adult in northwestern Ecuador. Home range estimates were 42.2 ha (minimum convex polygon) and 49.9 ha (95% kernel analysis); the core area was 3.4 ha (50% kernel analysis). The bird favored undisturbed habitat and avoided secondary forest. It was primarily insectivorous and rarely associated with army ants (Eciton sp.) and not with mammals. Breeding occurred from March through June and the marked bird was seen with an unmarked individual througout, the study. The Banded Ground-cuckoos a large ionic range, limited dispersal ability, and apparently depends on undisturbed forest. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation appear to be the gravest threats facing the species.

Ludwig, Gilbert X.; Alatalo, Rauno V.; Helle, Pekka; Nissinen, Kari; Siitari, Heli				Journal of Applied Ecology	45	1		325-333	February 2008	2008							1. The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding success of three forest grouse species in Finland.2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to the Akaike information criterion.3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most intensive.4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect, but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are likely to involve drowning of chicks.5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining ones.								0021-8901							10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01396.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14407038645					J	ZOOR14406037327		Bird communities in rainforest fragments: guild responses to habitat variables in Tabasco, Mexico.		Arriaga-Weiss, Stefan L.; Calme, Sophie; Kampichler, Christian				Biodiversity and Conservation	17	1		173-190	January 2008	2008							The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical forests are difficult to separate, as they usually occur concurrently. In the state park La Sierra, in Tabasco, Mexico, the rainforest is being cleared for pasture, and fragments are being used by local inhabitants. This study examined the response of bird feeding guilds to habitat characteristics, including human disturbance, in five fragments of different sizes (1 [approximately] 4,500 ha, 2 [approximately] 150 ha, and 2 [approximately] 80 ha). Using point count observations, 125 species were recorded and were grouped into 11 feeding guilds. As expected, the largest fragment had higher species richness and abundances than the smaller fragments. However, five habitat features differed significantly among fragment sizes, including tree density, the number of tree stumps and the number of trails. Thus the larger fragment was also less disturbed. Fragment size alone was significant only for scavenger species richness, and for the abundance of bark gleaning insectivores and insectivore/nectarivores. Raptors were more diverse and abundant in the large fragment and less disturbed sites. Arboreal frugivores and bark or foliage gleaning insectivores, depended on higher trees and less disturbed sites. A better understanding of the mechanisms that affect persistence is essential for the planning of conservation actions.

Keuroghlian, Alexine; Eaton, Donald P.				Biotropica	40	1		62-70	January 2008	2008							The goal of this study was to examine seasonal frugivory by two sympatric peccary species (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) in a small (2178 ha), Atlantic Forest fragment on the inland plateau region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Fruit availability was determined with systematic ground surveys conducted over a 5-yr period. Examining fruit availability trends for dry and wet seasons, we found that species diversity was greater in the wet season, but the total number and dry mass of fruits were higher in the dry season. Fruit abundance in the dry season was due to one palm, 'jeriva' (Syagrus romanzoffiana), which could be considered a keystone species at Caetetus Ecological Station as it also supported a diverse array of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. White-lipped peccaries were the only ungulates that ate palmito fruits (Euterpe edulis) at Caetetus. They consumed ripe and unripe fruits and predated the seeds by chewing the pulp and seed. This occurred primarily during the dry season and was associated with a seasonal range shift and a preference for palmito habitat by the white-lipped peccaries. The dominance of fruits in peccary diets (80% fruit items in scat) has management implications for other plateau forest fragments. Forest fragments with diminished fruit abundance or diversity, or lacking key species such as S. romanzoffiana or E. edulis, will not support the energetic requirements of the characteristically large and highly mobile white-lipped peccary populations.								0006-3606								ZOOREC:ZOOR14407038353					B	ZOOR14509058464		Danger in the nursery: impact on birds of tar sands oil development in Canada's boreal forest.		Wells, Jeff; Casey-Lefkowitz, Susan; Chavarria, Gabriela; Dyer, Simon	Wells, Jeff; Casey-Lefkowitz, Susan; Chavarria, Gabriela; Dyer, Simon			Danger in the nursery: impact on birds of tar sands oil development in Canada's boreal forest.				i-vi, 1-33	2008	2008							Each spring more than half of America's birds flock to the Canadian Boreal forest to nest. There, a square mile (2.5 square kilometers) of forests, lakes, river valleys, and wetlands can support as many as 500 breeding pairs of migratory birds. Yet almost all the biggest oil companies are mining and drilling important Boreal forest and wetlands- that could eventually cover an area the size of Florida - to access thick, low-grade petroleum. Canada and the United States must protect migratory birds and bird habitat from this new form of high-impact energy development. Tar sands oil development creates open-pit mines, habitat fragmentation, toxic waste holding ponds, air and water pollution, upgraders and refineries, and pipelines spreading far beyond the Boreal forest. This development is destroying habitat for waterfowl and songbirds that come from all over the Americas to nest in the Boreal. Each year between 22 million and 170 million birds breed in the 35 million acres of Boreal forest that could eventually be developed for tar sands oil. Faced with tar sands development, migrating birds don't just move elsewhere, since they depend on a certain type of habitat. Not only do many adult birds die when faced with lost and fragmented habitat and ponds of mining waste, but future generations of birds will have lost their chance to exist. The Boreal forest tar sands area is incredibly important for birds as a breeding habitat and as a globally important flyway for a great abundance and diversity of wetland- dependent birds. Unfortunately the rapidly expanding industrial tar sands oil extraction operations increasingly place these birds at risk.Virtually every facet of tar sands oil development has the potential to harm Boreal birds - many of which are migratory birds that are protected by treaty and national law. Combining the various estimates of the loss of birds from mining and in situ operations, this report projects a cumulative impact over the next 30 to 50 years ranging from a low of about 6 million birds lost to as high as 166 million birds lost. Beyond the direct habitat effects, there are many other impacts to birds that, while harder to quantify, are known or expected to cause significant problems for birds and other wildlife. Tar Sands Mining Causes Bird Habitat Loss: The projected strip-mining of 740,000 acres (300,000 hectares) of forests and wetlands in the tar sands will result in the loss of breeding habitat for between 480,000 and 3.6 million adult birds. The corresponding impact on breeding will mean a loss of 4.8 million to 36 million young birds over a 20-year period, and 9.6 million to 72 million birds over a 40-year period.Tailings Ponds Result in Oiled Birds: Annual bird mortality from landing and drowning in the oily water in current tar sands tailings ponds could range from more than 8,000 birds to well over 100,000. A doubling of tailings ponds - likely with proposed tar sands mining expansions - would increase projected annual bird deaths to between 17,000 and 300,000 individuals. Tar Sands Drilling Fragments Bird Habitat: Tar sands drilling projects are projected to result in the loss of more forest-dependent bird habitat than strip-mining and could harm as many as 14.5 million breeding birds from direct habitat loss and as many as 76 million birds from fragmentation and habitat degradation over a 30- to 50-year period. Water Withdrawals Harm Wetlands and Water Habitats: Current tar sands operations are permitted to remove enough water to meet the needs of a city of 3 million people, and water removal is projected to increase by 50 percent as planned tar sands projects become operational. Changes to Alberta's rivers and underground reservoirs could have profound impacts on the hundreds of thousands of birds that are dependent on the wetland habitats in the tar sands and Peace- Athabasca Delta and other parts of the Mackenzie River watershed. Air and Water Toxins Bioaccumulate: Major impacts are likely from tar sands air and water pollution, which causes the accumulation of toxins in tissues, and from acid rain and nitrogen deposition, air pollution, and heavy metals. Birds can inhale, ingest, or come into contact with contaminants; these contaminants can build up in the tissues and lead to weakened birds, problems with reproduction, and often to eventual death. Pollution can also lead to changes in habitat and food, which will indirectly harm the health of birds. And these effects are not limited to birds - tar sands toxins can affect other wildlife and local human populations as well. Global Warming Contributed to by Tar Sands Is Already Affecting Boreal Birds: The tar sands are Canada's fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, producing as much as three times the global warming pollution per barrel from the production process as conventional oil production. The Boreal ecosystem is at the frontlines in feeling the impacts of global warming - and so are Boreal birds. Long-distance migratory birds may arrive too late to find food as insects emerge earlier in the spring due to warmer temperatures. Birds that hoard food to get through the winter and to start feeding their young in the spring may find that the food spoils before the first freeze. Global warming could hit ducks especially hard as wetlands become drier.Recommendations for Protecting Boreal Birds Many scientific reports on the status of the planet's birds over the past 20 years warn of drastic declines and looming extinctions. This report echoes these cautions and challenges decision- makers and companies to get it right in Canada's Boreal forest, while there is still time to save the great bird nursery of the Americas. Tar sands oil development should not be the solution to our fuel needs. Both Canada and the United States have a choice to make between fuels that harm the environment (including damage to critical bird habitat) and clean energy now. An immediate solution to the pace of development and to environmental problems relating to tar sands oil development is a moratorium on new projects and project expansions and clean up of existing projects. Alberta needs to prove that even the current level of production can be done without serious environmental impacts. At the same time, U.S., Canadian, and domestic and international regulations must be strengthened to protect the Boreal forest and the birds who make the forest their home. And oil companies should adhere to strict standards of best practices for their current operations in order to protect habitat and minimize their impact on land, air, and water.

Williams, Stephen E.; Middleton, Jeffery				Diversity and Distributions	14	1		69-77	January 2008	2008							We demonstrate that within-year climatic variability, particularly rainfall seasonality, is the most significant variable explaining spatial patterns of bird abundance in Australian tropical rainforest. The likely mechanism causing this pattern is a resource bottleneck (insects, nectar, and fruit) during the dry season that limits the population size of many species. The patterns support both the diversity-climatic-stability hypothesis and the species-energy hypothesis but clearly show that seasonality in energy availability may be a more significant factor than annual totals or means. An index of dry season severity is proposed that quantifies the combined effect of the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry season. We suggest that the predicted increases in seasonality due to global climate change could produce significant declines in bird abundance, further exacerbating the impacts of decreased range size, increased fragmentation, and decreased population size likely to occur as a result of increasing temperature. We suggest that increasing climatic seasonality due to global climate change has the potential to have significant negative impacts on tropical biodiversity.

Matthysen, Erik; Collet, Filip; Cahill, Jennifer				Ornitologia Neotropical	19	3		403-416	2008	2008							Mixed-species foraging flocks of birds are found in many forest communities, both in temperate and tropical forests. Such flocks are typically highly structured in terms of foraging behavior, with different species occupying different foraging niches with respect to foraging positions and/or techniques. In the Neotropics, most Studies have focused on species-rich flocks in lowland tropical forest, but little has been published on less diverse communities in montane Andean forests. We studied the composition and foraging behavior of birds in mixed insectivorous flocks in two small fragments of high-Andean Polylepis (Rosaceae) woodland near Cochabamba, Bolivia. One site represented largely undisturbed forest, while the other was more subject to anthropogenic influences clue to clearing, grazing and small-scale agriculture inside the remaining forest. Flocks were small in both areas (4-5 individuals per flock), but flock composition differed markedly between the two sites. In the undisturbed site, flocks were dominated by Polylepis habitat specialists, while non-specialists were numerically dominant in the disturbed site. Species were clearly separated by foraging mode and preferred foraging Substrate in the undisturbed site, but not so in the disturbed site. In the undisturbed site there was evidence for niche divergence between at least one pair of the main flocking species, while in the disturbed site some species tended to converge in foraging behavior when in each other's presence. It is concluded that both flock composition and flock structure in terms of niche separation differ markedly between the two sites, perhaps clue to the lower abundance of specialist species in the disturbed site.								1075-4377								ZOOREC:ZOOR14503013485					J	ZOOR14404021434		Winter habits and food habits of short-eared owls at Gaoping Airport of Nanchong.

Christianini, Alexander V.; Galetti, Mauro				Acta Oecologica	32	3		328-336	November-December 2007	2007							Studies of post-dispersal seed removal in the Neotropics have rarely examined the magnitude of seed removal by different types of granivores. The relative impact of invertebrates, small rodents, and birds on seed removal was investigated in a 2,178 ha Atlantic forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. We used popcorn kernels (Zea mays - Poaceae) to investigate seed removal in a series of selective exclosure treatments in a replicated, paired design experiment that included forest understory, gaps, and forest edge sites. We recorded the vegetation around the experimental seed stations in detail in order to evaluate the influence of microhabitat traits on seed removal. Vertebrate granivores (rodents and birds) were surveyed to determine whether granivore abundance was correlated with seed removal levels. Seed removal varied spatially and in unpredictable ways at the study site. Seed encounter and seed use varied with treatments, but not with habitat type. However, seed removal by invertebrates was negatively correlated with gap-related traits, which suggested an avoidance of large gaps by granivorous ants. The abundance of small mammals was remarkably low, but granivorous birds (tinamous and doves) were abundant at the study site. Birds were the main seed consumers in open treatments, but there was no correlation between local granivorous bird abundance and seed removal. These results emphasize the stochastic spatial pattern of seed removal, and, contrary to previous studies, highlight the importance of birds as seed predators in forest habitats.

Australian Journal of Entomology	46	4		325-331	16 October 2007	2007							The value of insectivorous birds as agents for biological control of arthropod pests has been little studied, especially in Australia. This paper reports on the extent to which arthropods from various pest and non-pest taxa feature in the diets of birds captured in farm shelterbelts in central western New South Wales. The parameters examined were the types of arthropod fragments in bird faeces and percentage volume and frequency of occurrence of each component. The faecal data were compared with samples of the arthropod fauna trapped in shelterbelts during the period the birds were captured. In 26 of 29 faecal samples, arthropod fragments were the predominant components, the most common being from Coleoptera, Hymenoptera (especially Formicidae), Orthoptera and Araneae. The recognisable pest taxa in faecal samples were Scarabaeidae and wingless grasshopper Phaulacridium vittatum (Sjostedt) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). The results indicate that the native bird species common in farm shelterbelts preyed on a range of arthropod taxa including several that are pests of crops and pastures.

Kossenko, Serguei M.; Kaygorodova, Evgeniya Yu.				Ardea	95	2		177-189	Autumn 2007	2007							The Nerussa-Desna woodland (south-western Russia) is one of the core areas for the Middle Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius, a habitat specialist restricted mainly to mature oak forests. Recent studies have shown a lower breeding density of the species in fragmented compared with continuous habitat. To evaluate reproduction as a possible mechanism underlying the fragmentation effects, we studied reproductive performance of the specie, in both continuous habitat and fragmented habitat in the forested landscapes of the Nerussa-Desna woodland. During 1997-2001, annual variation of reproductive indices in both continuous and fragmented habitat was insignificant. None of the indices was significantly lower in fragmented habitat though nestling losses were significantly higher in fragments. Timing of breeding in 2000 was later in fragmented than continuous habitat, probably due to differential landscape phenology. in fragments, fledging success in a year was inversely related to the mean amount of rain. On the basis of individual pairs, fledgling production also correlated significantly and negatively with the amount of rain during the nestling period in food-poor fragments only In 19992001, abundance of Lepidoptera larvae, main food for the Middle Spotted Woodpecker during nestling phase, varied significantly in continuous habitat, whereas in fragmented habitat the patterns of variation differed between fragments. No significant correlation was found between larval density and reproductive performance of individual pairs in either habitat. Large oak density a habitat feature related to potential food abundance, was higher in fragments than in continuous habitat but was not related to the reproductive performance. The lower larval density within some territories in fragments as opposed to continuous habitat is likely to explain higher nestling mortality in fragmented compared to continuous habitat. Generally, we found little evidence for lowered reproductive performance in relation to fragmentation. Therefore, this seems unlikely to be responsible for the fragmentation-sensitive patterns of density.								0373-2266							10.5253/078.095.0202	ZOOREC:ZOOR14403017019					J	ZOOR14405028939		Patch and landscape factors shape community assemblage of bumble bees, Bombus spp. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), in montane meadows.		Hatfield, Richard G.; LeBuhn, Gretchen				Biological Conservation	139	1-2		150-158	September 2007	2007							Understanding the scale at which habitat influences species richness in terrestrial ecosystems is central to both ecology and conservation biology (Wettstein, W., Schmid, B., 1999. Conservation of arthropod diversity in montane wetlands: effect of altitude, habitat quality and habitat fragmentation on butterflies and grasshoppers. Journal of Applied Ecology, 36, 363-373). Community composition may be influenced by habitat variation at patch and/or landscape-scales depending on the body size, home range area, and dispersal distances of the focal taxa (Calder III, W.A., 1984.

Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B 267, 139-145), not merely their phylogenetic affinity. We investigated the importance of habitat variables at different scales on the richness and abundance of bumble bees both annually and seasonally in Sierran montane meadows over two years. We found that both patch and landscape factors influence the species richness and abundance of bumble bees and these factors have a seasonal component to their importance. The proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat was the most consistent positive influence on both species richness and abundance across years. In the second year, 2003, patch factors, plant species richness and current livestock grazing also influenced bumblebee species richness; plant species richness was positively correlated and current livestock grazing was negatively correlated with bumble bee species richness. Bumble bee abundance was positively influenced by meadow wetness and proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat in both years. These data suggest conservation of pollinators depends on conservation planning with attention to the quality and context of the landscape.								0006-3207							10.1016/j.biocon.2007.06.019	ZOOREC:ZOOR14405028939					J	ZOOR14405030014		Fragmentation and elevation effects on bird-army ant interactions in neotropical montane forest of Costa Rica.		Kumar, Anjali; O'Donnell, Sean				Journal of Tropical Ecology	23	5		581-590	September 2007	2007							Army ants (Formicidae: Ecitoninae) are top predators in neotropical forests. Army ant raids support a community of diverse organisms, including birds that attend the raids to collect prey. While elevation and forest fragmentation influence army ant and insectivorous bird communities, their effects on the interaction between army ants and bird species is unknown. We studied the size and species composition of bird flocks attending army ant swarms in forest fragments and continuous forest across an elevational gradient (1100-1680 m asl) in a neotropical montane region (Monteverde, Costa Rica). We observed a total of 41 bird species attending army ant swarms. Neither the number of birds, nor the total body mass of birds, nor the number of bird species in attending bird flocks was related to elevation. However, we found a higher bird species richness, larger flock size and greater total body mass of birds attending army ant swarms in continuous forest. Continuous and fragmented forest shared many attending bird species in common, but there was elevational segregation of attending bird species. Some montane endemic birds, and neotropical migrants, attend swarms regularly and use army ant raids as a food source.								0266-4674							10.1017/S0266467407004270	ZOOREC:ZOOR14405030014					J	ZOOR14311070373		Bird diversity in cacao farms and forest fragments of western Panama.		Van Bael, Sunshine A.; Bichier, Peter; Ochoa, Isis; Greenberg, Russell				Biodiversity and Conservation	16	8		2245-2256	July 2007	2007							Theobroma cacao plantings, when managed under the shade of rainforest trees, provide habitat for many resident and migratory bird species. We compared the bird diversity and community structure in organic cacao farms and nearby forest fragments throughout mainland Bocas del Toro, Panama. We used this dataset to ask the following questions: (1) How do bird communities using cacao habitat compare to communities of nearby forest fragments? (2) To what extent do Northern migratory birds use shaded cacao farms, and do communities of resident birds shift their abundances in cacao farms seasonally? (3) Do small scale changes in shade management of cacao farms affect bird diversity? Using fixed radius point counts and additional observations, we recorded 234 landbird species, with 102 species that were observed in both cacao and forest fragments, 86 species that were only observed in cacao farms, and 46 species that were restricted to forest fragments. Cacao farms were rich in canopy and edge species such as tanagers, flycatchers and migratory warblers, but understory insectivores were nearly absent from cacao farms. We observed 27 migratory species, with 18 species in cacao farms only, two species in forest only, and seven species that occurred in both habitats. In cacao farms, the diversity of birds was significantly greater where there was less intensive management of the canopy shade trees. Shade tree species richness was most important for explaining variance in bird diversity. Our study shows that shaded cacao farms in western Panama provide habitat for a wide variety of resident and migratory bird species. Considering current land use trends in the region, we suggest that action must be taken to prevent conversion away from shaded cacao farms to land uses with lower biodiversity conservation value.

Rodriguez, Alejandro; Jansson, Gunnar; Andren, Henrik				Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B	274	1616		1403-1411	June 7 2007	2007							Assuming better colonization abilities of inferior competitors, the competition-colonization trade-off (CCTO) is one of the hypotheses that explains spatial variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Whereas this mechanism may structure some plant and insect communities, ecologists have failed to document its operation in other natural systems, and its generality has been questioned. We combined fieldwork and published data to study the composition of a guild of passerines (Parus cristatus, Parus montanus, Parus ater and Regulus regulus) inhabiting 10 landscapes that differed in the amount of forest habitat. The species were ordered in a stable, well-defined competitive hierarchy, and the dispersal ability of each species was inversely correlated with its position in this hierarchy. In functionally continuous landscapes, superior competitors occupied most fragments and all guild members commonly occurred. The relative incidences of superior and inferior competitors were reversed, and differences amplified, in landscapes where patches were physically (distance) or functionally (matrix hardness) isolated. We found little support for two competing hypotheses, namely reduced habitat quality in isolated patches and lower abundance of a keystone predator (Glaucidium passerinum) in fragmented landscapes. We concluded that the CCTO offered the most probable explanation for variation in the composition of the Parus guild across landscapes.

Stouffer, Philip C.; Bierregaard, Richard O., Jr				Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia	15	2		219-229	June 2007	2007							Understory bird communities have been studied in a series of Amazonian rainforest fragments near Manaus, Brazil for about 20 years. Previous analysis of standardized mist-net samples revealed considerable temporal dynamism in capture rates, with communities in fragments responding to growth or cutting of the second growth matrix. This pattern was superimposed on expected fragment size effects among the 1-, 10-, and 100-ha fragments. Here we extend our earlier analysis of landscape effects by separately considering 1- and 10-ha fragments, with the goal of describing the recovery of bird communities in fragments surrounded by abandoned second growth. Most guilds, with the exception of terrestrial insectivores, appear to be on a trajectory to return to pre-isolation abundance in 10-ha fragments Within about 40 years. Although some guilds showed similar recovery in 1-ha fragments, these were mostly species also common in second growth. Our results suggest that matrix development can allow bird communities to approach pre-isolation structure in fragments of at least 10 ha, but we emphasize that this conclusion represents a best-case scenario facilitated by the proximity to primary forest of the fragments we studied.

Donatelli, Reginaldo J.; Ferreira, Carolina D.; Dalbeto, Andreli C.; Posso, Sergio R.				Revista Brasileira de Zoologia	24	2		362-375	junho 2007	2007							Comparative analysis of birds community in two forested fragments in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Qualitative and quantitative survey of bird community were performed in two distinct semideciduous forest in the interior of the State of Sao Paulo from July 2004 to July 2005. Point Counts were used for the quantitative survey followed by diversity and frequence of ocurrence indexes of the bird assemblage. The qualitative survey registered a total of 181 species of birds at Fazenda Rio das Pedras (FRP, Itapetininga, 350 ha) and 126 at Fazenda Santa Maria 11 (FSM 11, Buri, 260 ha). The qualitative survey registered 73 species in 998 contacts and 64 species en 1019 contacts, respectively, for FRP and FSM II. The ponctual index of abundance (IPA) varied from 0.01 (one contact) to 1.32 (132 contacts) at FRP and from 0.01 (one contact) to 0.97 (97 contacts) at FSM H.The general diversity index for FRP was H' = 2.85 and H' = 3.04 at FSM II. Both areas presented an evenness index of E = 0.91. The bird community in both patched of forest showed the same pattern found in other different forest fragments of relative size studies by many distinct authors. In both localities, insectivorus (53% at FSM e 50% at FRP) and frugivorus (23% na FSM e 26% na FRP) birds were the most representative. Among the former, Tyrannidae and Thamnophilidae were predominant, respectively, at FSM and FRP. In both places understory insectivorous birds were dominant (53% at FSM and 51,4% at FRP), followed by understory frugivorus at FSM (50%) and by canopy frugivorus (52,6%) at FRP.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology	119	2		205-220	June 2007	2007							Tropical birds may differ from temperate birds in their sensitivity to forest edges. We provide predictions about the proportions of tropical and temperate species that should avoid or exploit edges, and relationships between natural-history characters and edge responses. We conducted exploratory meta-analyses from 11 studies using 287 records of 220 neotropical and temperate species' responses to edges to address our predictions. A higher proportion of neotropical species were edge-avoiders compared with temperate species and a higher proportion of temperate species were edge-exploiters compared with neotropical species. Edge-avoiding responses were positively associated with being an insectivore for neotropical birds, and with being of small body mass and a latitudinal migrant for temperate birds. Temperate edge-exploiters were less likely to be insectivores and migrants than temperate birds that were not edge-exploiters. A greater proportion of neotropical birds than temperate birds may be at risk from forest fragmentation if edge-avoidance is a reasonable indicator of an inability to adapt to land-cover change. Future progress in our understanding of forest bird responses to edges is dependent upon greater standardization of methods and designing studies in the context of recent theoretical developments.

Kotze, D. Johan; Lawes, Michael J.				Austral Ecology	32	3		294-304	May 2007	2007							The conservation of biodiversity is dependent on protecting ecosystem-level processes. We investigated the effects of fragment size and habitat edge on the relative functioning of three ecological processes - decomposition, predation and regeneration of trees - in small Afromontane forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ten sampling stations were placed in each of four forest categories: the interior of three large indigenous forest fragments (100 m from the edge), the edges of these large fragments, 10 small indigenous fragments (1 ha) and 10 small exotic woodlands (0.5 ha). Fragment size and edge effects did not affect the abundance of the amphipod Talitriator africana, a litter decomposer, and overall dung beetle abundance and species richness significantly. Bird egg predation was marginally greater at large patch edges compared with the other forest categories, while seed predation did not differ among forest categories. Tree seedling assemblage composition did not differ significantly among large patch interiors and edges, and small indigenous fragments. Sapling and canopy assemblage composition each differed significantly among these three indigenous forest categories. Thus, while tree recruitment was not negatively affected by patch size or distance from the edge, conditions in small fragments and at edges appear to affect the composition of advanced tree regeneration. These ecological processes in Afromontane forests appear to be resilient to fragmentation effects. We speculate that this is because the organisms in these forests have evolved under fragmented conditions. Repeated extreme changes in climate and vegetation over the Pleistocene have acted as significant distribution and ecological extinction filters on these southern hemisphere forest biota, resulting in fauna and flora that are potentially resilient to contemporary fragmentation effects. We argue that because small patches and habitat edges appear to be ecologically viable they should be included in future conservation decisions.

We placed 38 transects, sampling 2,280 individuals and 121 species. As expected in Neotropical regions, bee-pollination was the most frequent pollination system. We found a decrease in the frequency of plants pollinated by beetles towards the fragment interior. Similarly, we found significant variation in relation to height just for the bats; there was an increase in the frequency of plants pollinated by bats towards the higher heights. In general, we found no horizontal and vertical variation in the pollination systems, probably as consequence of the more open physiognomy of the cerrado vegetation.

Wegge, Per; Kastdalen, Leif				Annales Zoologici Fennici	44	2		141-151	April 25 2007	2007							Over a 3-year period, we equipped 115 newly hatched capercaillie chicks in 29 broods with small radio transmitters in southeast Norway. Besides monitoring the fate of the chicks, we measured the abundance of microtine rodents and insect food and, together with weather records, we examined the observed mortality in relation to these factors. On average, 57% of the chicks died within the first month of life. Mortality was highest during the first 3 weeks, coinciding with the period when chicks feed almost exclusively on insects, depend heavily on their mother for maintaining body warmth, and cannot fly well. Predation was by far the most important proximate cause of mortality, accounting for 90% of all observed losses. Only 7% of the losses could be ascribed to direct effects of cold and wet weather, all recorded during the first 8 days of life. However, because predation losses were also quite high during and immediately after heavy rainfalls, adverse weather probably predisposed the chicks to mammalian predation. Most chicks were killed by mustelids, mainly pine martens; low numbers of red fox due to sarcoptic mange probably explains the low proportion taken by this predator. Among known predation losses (N = 40), goshawks accounted for a minimum of 25%. Chick mortality during the first month varied markedly (29%-83%) among the three years. It was highest in the year when June weather was exceptionally wet and cold; the same year when the density of microtine rodents and food abundance in terms of insect larvae were highest. Net production in late August was poorly related to chick loss during the first month posthatch.								0003-455X								ZOOREC:ZOOR14310063755					J	ZOOR14309055923		Scale-dependent effects of habitat fragmentation on hawthorn pollination, frugivory, and seed predation.		Garcia, Daniel; Chacoff, Natacha P.				Conservation Biology	21	2		400-411	April 2007	2007							Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, firugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and post dispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover Similarly, the magnitude of firugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration.

Fujita, Motoko; Koike, Fumito				Ecological Applications	17	3		648-654	April 2007	2007							The influence of urbanization on nutrient cycling is vaguely known. Here we document that birds, especially those increasing in urban areas ( such as crows, Corvus macrorhynchos and C. corone), affect nutrient cycles. Using fecal traps, we measured phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) input from the excrement of birds in fragmented forests in an urban landscape. Sources of avian feces were examined on the basis of carbon ( C), N, and P percentages and stable isotopes of [delta]15N and [delta]13C. Nitrogen and P input was aggregated in the urban landscape, being especially high at the forest where crows roosted during winter. The annual P input due to bird droppings ( range 0.068-0.460 kg . ha-1 . yr-1; mean 0.167 kg . ha-1 . yr-1) was 12.4% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 52.9% in the evergreen forest where crows roosted. The annual N input due to bird droppings ( range 0.44-3.49 kg . ha-1 . yr-1; mean 1.15 kg . ha-1 . yr-1) was 5.2% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 27.0% in the evergreen forest used by roosting crows. Expected sources of nutrients in feces included insects in the breeding season, fruits in autumn, and mammals and birds in winter. Stable isotopes suggested that the source of nutrients in forests used by roosting crows was from outside the forest. Therefore, birds played a significant role as transporters of nutrients from garbage (including fish, livestock, and/or C4 plants such as corn, with high [delta]15N and [delta]13C) in residential and business areas to fragmented evergreen forests, especially near their winter roosts.

Barbaro, Luc; Rossi, Jean-Pierre; Vetillard, Jean-Pierre; Nezan, Julien; Jactel, Herve				Journal of Biogeography	34	4		652-664	April 2007	2007							Aim To evaluate the joint and independent effects of spatial location, landscape composition and landscape structure on the distribution patterns of bird and carabid beetle assemblages in a mosaic landscape dominated by pine plantation forests. Location A continuous 3000-ha landscape mosaic with native maritime pine Pinus pinaster plantations of different ages, deciduous woodlands and open habitats, located in the Landes de Gascogne forest of south-western France. Methods We sampled breeding birds by 20-min point counts and carabid beetles by pitfall trapping using a systematic grid sampling of 200 points every 400 m over the whole landscape. Explanatory variables were composed of three data sets derived from GIS habitat mapping: (1) spatial variables (polynomial terms of geographical coordinates of samples), (2) landscape composition as the percentage cover of the six main habitats, and (3) landscape structure metrics including indices of fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity. We used canonical correspondence analysis with variance partitioning to evaluate the joint and independent effects of the three sets of variables on the ordination of species assemblages. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel tests were used to assess for spatial structure in species distribution and relationships with separate landscape attributes. Results Landscape composition was the main factor explaining the distribution patterns of birds and carabids at the mesoscale of 400 x 400 m. Independent effects of spatial variables and landscape structure were still significant for bird assemblages once landscape composition was controlled for, but not for carabid assemblages. Spatial distributions of birds and carabids were primarily influenced by the amount of heathlands, young pine plantations, herbaceous firebreaks and deciduous woodlands. Deciduous woodland species had positive responses to edge density, while open habitat species were positively associated with mean patch area. Main conclusions Forest birds were favoured by an increase in deciduous woodland cover and landscape heterogeneity, but there was no evidence for a similar effect on carabid beetles. Fragmentation of open habitats negatively affected both early-successional birds and carabids, specialist species being restricted to large heathlands and young plantations. Several birds of conservation concern were associated with mosaics of woodlands and grasslands, especially meadows and firebreaks. Conserving biodiversity in mosaic plantation landscapes could be achieved by the maintenance of a significant amount of early-successional habitats and deciduous woodland patches within a conifer plantation matrix.

The aims of the study were to: (1) determine how bird densities and species richness varied with remnant category; (2) determine how ranked densities of bird species varied by feeding group with remnant category; and (3) provide information on structures of bird communities in box/cypress pine woodlands to guide restoration. Structures of bird communities varied with remnant category. Large remnants had the most species whereas medium-sized and small remnants in low condition had the fewest. Bird densities increased with decreasing remnant area although densities did not differ significantly between remnant categories. Ranked bird densities varied between remnant categories, with relatively even distributions in large remnants in high condition, and uneven distributions in small remnants in low condition. Densities of small insectivores were much lower in small, low-condition remnants than in large, high-condition remnants. Densities of generalists such as noisy miner and galah showed the reverse pattern. The structures of bird communities in large remnants in good condition provide a reference state for assessing recovery of bird communities.								0004-959X							10.1071/ZO06064	ZOOREC:ZOOR14308051197					J	ZOOR14409055752		Vistula River valley as the ecological corridor for mammals.		Romanowski, Jerzy				Polish Journal of Ecology	55	4		805-819	2007	2007							River Vistula, one of the large (1047 km in length) European rivers preserved in semi-natural, dynamic condition, is recognized as important corridor that enables birds and fishes to migrate for long distances. To test whether the Vistula valley provides corridor function also for mammals, field surveys and habitat modelling for six target species: Bank vole Myodes glareolus, Yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, Pine marten Martes martes, Beaver Castor fiber, Wild boar Sus scrofa, and Elk Alces alces, were undertaken in the 135 km long fragment of the valley from 529 (Warsaw) to 685 km (W3oc3awek). The data collected documented the occurrence of at least 51 mammals (5 Insectivora, 14 Chiroptera, 1 Lagomorpha, 16 Rodentia, 11 Carnivora, 4 Artiodactyla), and the highest species richness was noted in the fragment of river valley covered with mixed forests which makes up the protected area called Kampinos National Park. This protected area (385 km2) contains coniferous and mixed forests, inland dunes, wetlands, and mosaic of extensively used meadows, pastures, alder forests and fields. The LARCH (Landscape Ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat) (Van der Sluis and Romanowski 2005) model outputs indicated the potential for large viable populations of species analysed in the river valley. The LARCH SCAN analysis showed that habitats of modelled species were well connected and their local populations formed highly sustainable network. The spatial cohesion of habitats was generally highest in Kampinos NP and along the fragment of River Vistula from 580 to 618 km. It is concluded that high cohesion of habitats facilitates dispersion of animals and provides potential for gene flow among the populations in the valley. Riparian forests and islands are important for connecting the local populations of mammals of two river banks and are the key elements to provide functional continuity of the corridor along the river in places, where it is discontinued on one bank. The scenario analysis demonstrates potentially negative effects of river regulation and construction of two dams on viability of mammalian populations and spatial cohesion of their habitats. The future corridor function of the River Vistula valley depends mostly on preservation of it's dynamic, semi-natural condition.

Its typical seasonality influences the availability of resources, and the composition and organization of avifauna. Fragmentation and substitution of the forest for agricultural expansions, impact on these characteristics. This contribution provides the composition and richness of avifauna in relicts of the Oriental Chaco of Cordoba, and carries out ecological observations on trophic guilds, residence and conservation status, in order to interpret its current situation and to promote conservation. These forest remnants located between the Reserve of Mar Chiquita and Sierras del Norte, alternate with secondary forest, park and grassland, and cultivated parcels. From the 2000 winter to the 2002 autumn birds were observed seasonally in fixed points distributed at random. Characteristics detailed were: systematic classification, common name, population state, residence status and trophic guild. A high number of species (127) and interesting entities were found, according with the variety of ecosystem physiognomies and conditions in the area: threatened species (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus), in recovery (Ortalis canicollis), aquatic birds and "agricultural plagues". Permanent or resident species were the majority and their adaptation to the forest was expressed in diverse alimentary categories. Habitat alterations influenced a change of 24% in old permanent to occasional species. The spring-summer migrants -according to seasonal resources- tripled the winter ones. Permanent, migrants and occasional species participated in the insectivorous guild, according to a good provision of insects in semi-arid subtropical forest. Remainder biodiversity and functions of avifauna recommend the conservation of the Chaco forest in Cordoba.								1726-2216								ZOOREC:ZOOR14304026318					J	ZOOR14305029196		Patterns of animal diversity in different forms of tree cover in agricultural landscapes.		Harvey, Celia A.; Medina, Arnulfo; Merlo Sanchez, Dalia; Vilchez, Sergio; Hernandez, Blas; Saenz, Joel C.; Maes, Jean Michel; Casanoves, Fernando; Sinclair, Fergus L.				Ecological Applications	16	5		1986-1999	October 2006	2006							As tropical regions are converted to agriculture, conservation of biodiversity will depend not only on the maintenance of protected forest areas, but also on the scope for conservation within the agricultural matrix in which they are embedded. Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest: Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation.

Revista Brasileira de Zoologia	23	3		692-698	setembro 2006	2006							Territory size is ail important ecological attribute Of Populations that has been considered a factor determines population density. Antbirds is a large group of mainly insectivorous Neotropical passerines, usually well represented in bird communities from forested landscapes in Neotropical region. Territory sizes for three Antbirds, Thamnophilus caerulescens (Vieillot, 1816) (Variable Antshrike), Dysithamnus mentalis (Temmink, 1823) (Plain Antvireo) e Pyriglena leucoptera (Vieillot, 1818) (White-shouldered Fire-eye), were mapped and their area estimated by the convex polygon method in a 50 ha forest fragment, in southeastern Brazil. The three species presented small territories of similar sizes (:5 2 ha) both during the non-reproductive and the reproductive seasons of 2000-2001. Territories overlapped considerably among species but not intraspecifically. Territory sizes increased with body mass of the three species studied (P. leucoptera > T. caerulescens > D. mentalis). We failed to find any effect on territory size for the three species associated with forest edge or distance to the dirt road.

Stouffer, Philip C.; Bierregaard, Richard O., Jr.; Strong, Cheryl; Lovejoy, Thomas E.				Conservation Biology	20	4		1212-1223	August 2006	2006							The rainforests of the Amazon basin are being cut by humans at a rate >20,000 km2/year, leading to smaller and more isolated patches of forest, with remaining fragments often in the range of 1-100 ha. We analyzed samples of understory birds collected over 20 years from a standardized mist-netting program in 1- to 100-ha rainforest fragments in a dynamic Amazonian landscape near Manaus, Brazil. Across bird guilds, the condition of second growth immediately surrounding fragments was often as important as fragment size or local forest cover in explaining variation in abundance. Some fragments surrounded by 100 m of open pasture showed reductions in insectivorous bird abundance of over 95%, even in landscapes dominated by continuous forest and old second growth. These extreme reductions may be typical throughout Amazonia in small (=10 ba), isolated fragments of rainforest. Abundance for some guilds returned to preisolation levels in 10- and 100-ba fragments connected to continuous forest by 20-year-old second growth. Our results show that the consequences of Amazonian forest loss cannot be accurately described without explicit consideration of vegetation dynamics in matrix habitat Any dichotomous classification of the landscape into "forest" and "nonforest" misses essential information about the matrix.

Hannon, S.J.; Martin, K.				Journal of Zoology (London)	269	4		422-433	August 2006	2006							Information on survival and habitat use of juvenile animals during the transition period from parental independence to adulthood is sparse, yet survival during this period may be critical for maintaining populations. We review studies on habitat use and survival of juvenile grouse from hatch to recruitment to breeding populations the next spring. Mortality of juveniles was highest during the first 2 weeks after hatch, caused primarily by predation and exposure. Survival of juveniles during their first autumn and winter was usually lower than adults, particularly in autumn. Predation, mainly by raptors, was the main mortality agent. Juveniles did not appear to be more susceptible than adults to hunting, although hunting mortality was additive to overwinter mortality for several species or populations. For most species, juvenile survival was not related to movement distances or patterns. However, studies on grouse in forest habitats disconnected by extensive logging showed that dispersal distances increased and survival was reduced. During the first few weeks of life, chicks eat primarily insects and brood hens seek habitats that optimize a trade-off between insect abundance and cover. Vegetation must provide sufficient cover to impede predation but be sparse enough to allow movement of chicks. For most species, juveniles and adults used similar habitats in autumn and winter, although juveniles had higher variation in habitat use than adults, possibly due to the greater distances moved by juveniles during dispersal. Habitat use varied more between genders than age classes. Management actions should be directed towards the two demographic bottlenecks for juvenile survival: the first 2 weeks after hatch and the period of autumn when independent young are dispersing. The most direct management actions are the retention or restoration of brood-rearing habitats, the reduction of habitat fragmentation and the reduction of hunting during autumn movements and in source populations.

Biodiversity and Conservation	15	5		1845-1856	May 2006	2006							We studied the pollination and reproductive success in continuous and fragmented populations of Lapageria rosea, a self-compatible plant endemic to temperate forests of Chile. Pollinator abundance, visitation rates, flower abundance, nectar volume and concentration, pollen germination and fruit and seed production, were compared between continuous forest of 145 ha and four forest fragments of 6, 3, 3, and 1 ha respectively, surrounded by mature pine plantations of Pinus radiata. Flower abundance was lower in three out of four forest fragments relative to continuous forest. Nectar volume and sugar concentration did not differ between flowers in the two habitats. Pollinators of L. rosea, the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes and bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii were less abundant and visited flowers of L. rosea at lower rates in fragments than in continuous forest. In addition, in vitro rates of pollen germination were lower for flowers in forest fragments. The number of seeds per fruit was also lower in forest fragments. We suggest that fragmentation affects the reproductive success of L. rosea, lowering the total numbers of seeds produced and possibly compromising long term persistence of fragmented populations.

Smith, Lyndsay A.; Burke, Dawn M.; Nol, Erica; Elliott, Ken A.				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	36	5		1087-1096	May 2006	2006							Periodic partial harvesting of trees is an important economic activity within the highly fragmented woodlands of southern Ontario. We studied the population density, age structure, food abundance, productivity, and nest survival of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus) nesting in 35 deciduous woodlots with varying intensities of harvest. Heavily cut woodlots contained higher densities of territorial males and greater abundances of fruit-bearing shrubs compared with standard cut and reference sites (uncut for >13 years). Results based on insect sampling were mixed, depending on the sampling technique and sample date. All treatments were demographic sinks, with populations in this landscape showing annual declines of 19%#150;24%. Though the proportion of parasitized nests tended to be higher in heavily cut sites, harvesting had little effect on nest survival, nest initiation dates, clutch size, age structure, or the number of young fledged from a successful nest. Our results indicate that within the fragmented woodlots of southern Ontario, partial harvesting does not further degrade breeding habitat for Rose-breasted Grosbeaks. However, further research is needed to determine the underlying causes of population declines.								0045-5067							10.1139/X06-002	ZOOREC:ZOOR14211067413					J	ZOOR14209053880		Strengthened insectivory in a temperate fragmented forest.

Oecologia (Berlin)	148	1		137-143	May 2006	2006							Habitat fragmentation modifies ecological patterns and processes through changes in species richness and abundance. In the coastal Maulino forest, central Chile, both species richness and abundance of insectivorous birds increases in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. Through a field experiment, we examined larvae predation in fragmented forests. Higher richness and abundance of birds foraging at forest fragments translated into more insect larvae preyed upon in forest fragments than in continuous forest. The assessed level of insectivory in forest fragments agrees with lower herbivory levels in forest fragments. This pattern strongly suggests the strengthening of food interactions web in forest fragments of coastal Maulino forest.

Renner, Swen C.; Waltert, Matthias; Muehlenberg, Michael				Biodiversity and Conservation	15	4		1545-1575	April 2006	2006							Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a 102 ha plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area 'Northern Central American highlands' (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot.

In addition, the sensitivity level of each bird species to forest fragmentation in northern Parana (high, medium, and low) was compared to the Vicosa region, another fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest. Contrary to expectations, large body size and terrestrial/understory habits were not features clearly related to high sensitivity to forest fragmentation; but species with tolerance to edge did have lower sensitivity. I found also that specialized habitat/food were not good predictors of extinctions; the most specialized guilds, bamboo and vine-tangle insectivores and trunk and twig insectivores, had a high number of species with low sensitivity. Patterns of sensitivity were compared for 75 bird species that occurred in both northern Parana and Vicosa; higher incongruence occurred for 14 and 7 species considered as highly sensitive in Vicosa but were of medium or low sensitivity, respectively, in northern Parana. These differences may occur because sensitivity to habitat fragmentation may vary from the center to the periphery of a species' geographic range. Geographic variation in patterns of sensitivity to forest fragmentation may be important for conservation planning.

Based on ecoregion conservation methodology, 16 priority areas were identified. Of these, Qinling Mountains, Daba Mountains, Jinfo-Fanjing-Wulingyuan area, Minshan Mountains, Qionglai-Daxiangling Mountains, Gongga Mountains, and Three Parallel Rivers area are among the list of the highest priority areas, while Funiu Mountains, Micang Mountains, Zoige Plateau, Liangshan Mountains, Panzhihua-Xichang area, Zhongdian-Muli area, northwestern Sichuan Plateau, Upper Jinsha River Basin Alps-Ravines, and Nu-jiang-Lancang River Basin Alps-Ravines have high priority. At present, the distribution of nature reserves does not match the priority areas and linkages. Nature reserves cover a tiny proportion, or even none, of the priority areas or linkages; some are disturbed by intense human activities and are consequently severely fragmented. It is proposed here that existing nature reserves should be adjusted and new ones established to fill conservation gaps. In conjunction with national eco-construction programmes and biodiversity conservation actions, natural forests should be strictly protected, degraded vegetation should be effectively rehabilitated, and human economic activities should be strictly controlled to enhance the functions of the conservation priority areas and their linkages.								1005-0094								ZOOREC:ZOOR14207045435					J	ZOOR14206035132		Avian community response to lowland tropical rainforest isolation: 40 years of change at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.		Sigel, Bryan J.; Sherry, Thomas W.; Young, Bruce E.				Conservation Biology	20	1		111-121	February 2006	2006							Since 1960, most of the forest surrounding the La Selva Biological Station, an intensively studied tropical research facility in Costa Rica, has been converted to agricultural uses. We used quantitative censuses and analysis of previously published categorical abundances to assess changes in the bird community, and we evaluated potential causes of species-specific changes by assessing their association with habitat, diet, participation in mixed-species flocks, and nest type. Approximately the same percentage of species increased as decreased in abundance from 1960 to 1999 (10-20% of all species, depending on method of assessment). Diet was the single most important trait associated with declining species. At least 50% of the species that declined have insectivorous diets. Use of forest habitat and participation in mixed-species flocks were also significant factors associated with declines, but nest type was unrelated to change in abundance. The species that increased in abundance tended to occur in open habitats and have omnivorous diets. These results reinforce the importance of several population risk factors associated with tropical understory insectivory and mixed-species flocking: patchy spatial distribution, low population density, large home range, and dietary specialization. La Selva's protected area (1611 ha), despite a forested connection on one boundary with a higher elevation national park, is apparently too small to maintain at least one major guild (understory insectivores). This first quantitative assessment of bird community change at La Selva highlights the need to intensify study of the mechanisms and consequences of biological diversity change in tropical forest fragments.								0888-8892							10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00293.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14206035132	16909664				J	ZOOR14304024530		The avifauna in the Santa Luzia Municipal Park, urban zone of the municipality of Uberlandia, State of Minas Gerais.

A total of 130 species (16 orders, 39 families and 117 genera) was registered. Five species were endemic of the Cerrado: Antilophia galeata, Basileuterus leucophrys, Cyanocorax cristatellus, Hylocryptus rectirostris and Herpsilochmus longirostris. About 90% of the birds were classified as resident and probable resident. Insectivorous (n = 45) and omnivorous (n = 41) were predominant groups.

Biota Neotropica	6	2		1-19	2006	2006	http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/						In order to compare the bird communities' composition and their possible relationships, I sampled monthly from January to December 2002 in the Biosphere Reserve Montes Azules (REBIMA) and adjacent areas, Chiapas, Mexico. Data were obtained during 48 days of fieldwork in an area of 60 ha by site. I recorded 133 species, which represent 36% of the total number of species reported for the REBIMA. Highest species richness was found in the site 1 (well preserved forest with 113 spp). High similarity between the sites 1 and 4 were found (this last with 50% original vegetation, IS = 0.89). Approximately 80% of the species were residents; and insectivores were the best represented trophic guild (47 spp). All feeding guilds were represented in all sites showing differences in species richness and abundance. Variation in the richness and composition of bird communities among different sizes was due to the fact that some species may demonstrate a different response to the degree of forest fragmentation and habitat transformation. However, in spite of limited sampling efforts, the bird richness suggests that secondary habitats play an important role in the persistence of species in tropical ecosystems.								1676-0611								ZOOREC:ZOOR14302011803					J	ZOOR14302009855		Positive effects of forest edges on plant reproduction: literature review and a case study of bee visitation to flowers of Peraxilla tetrapetala (Loranthaceae).		Burgess, Victoria J.; Kelly, Dave; Robertson, Alastair W.; Ladley, Jenny J.				New Zealand Journal of Ecology	30	2		179-190	2006	2006							Positive effects of fragmentation on plant reproduction are uncommon; in a literature review we found significant negative effects on fruit or seed set for 50 plant species, compared to 26 species showing no effect, and only nine affected positively. One of these is the declining New Zealand mistletoe Peraxilla tetrapetala (Loranthaceae), and here we investigate the mechanism of this positive effect. P. tetrapetala requires visits from native bird or bee pollinators to produce fruit. Fruit set was consistently pollen limited at several South Island sites because of a shortage of pollinators, but within a site at Lake Ohau, plants on forest edges had higher fruit set than those in the forest interior. Previous work showed that this difference was not caused by a shortage of resources in interior plants, but was associated with higher bird visitation rates to flowers on edges. In this study, we tested whether native bees also show a preference for edge flowers. At two sites (Ohau and Craigieburn) edge mistletoes had higher visitation by native bees (Hylaeus agilis and Leioproctus sp.) and higher fruit set. Some, but not all, of the higher visitation to edge flowers was explained by a preference amongst bees for flowers in direct sunshine. Therefore, P. tetrapetala experiences higher fruit set on edges because both of its main groups of pollinators (endemic birds and bees) visit edge flowers more often. The other eight published cases of positive effects of fragmentation on fruit set also all reported increased visitation rates by pollinators.

The basic diet of sampled species and their trophic guild allocation were determined. The study was carried out by means of capture with mist nets, visual and auditive records and analysis of faeces. Forty-four species were recorded and grouped in eight trophic guilds (insectivores, granivores, carnivores, frugivores, piscivores, nectarivores, omnivores and carrion eaters). The species were also allocated into smaller guilds, associated to their habitats. Some species only fly over the fragments, as Egretta Chula (Molina, 1782), while others are residents, as Manacus manacus (Linnaeus, 1766), and some used these fragments for nocturnal resting, as Amazona amazonica (Linnaeus, 1766). Small understory species apparently do not travel between fragments, given their relatively large spacing. Raptors, such as Rupornis magnirostris (Gmelin, 1789) live in both fragments and nearby open areas. Fragments in critical situation, supporting mainly generalists and/or edge species, still support some species with ecological interest, such as Rhynchocyclus olivaceus (Temminck, 1820) and A. amazonica.

Uezu, Alexandre; Metzger, Jean Paul; Vielliard, Jacques M.E.				Biological Conservation	123	4		507-519	June 2005	2005							We studied the importance of fragment size and structural and functional connectivity on the occurrence and abundance of seven Atlantic Forest bird species in 13 patches (13-275 ha) and three sites within a continuous forest (10,000 ha). We sampled birds with point counts and evaluated structural connectivity considering the presence of corridors and the degree of isolation. We defined functional connectivity by analyzing species movements using playbacks in forest corridors between fragments and in the surrounding matrix. Species differed in their responses to fragmentation. For the frugivorous species, Trogon surrucura, Carpornis cucullatus and Triclaria malachitacea, patch size was the main factor determining abundance. Two understory insectivorous species, Basileuterus leucoblepharus and Pyriglena leucoptera, were more affected by the degree of patch connectivity, the former by the presence of corridors and the latter by the distance between patches. The capacity of P. leucoptera to use corridors and open areas (i.e. functional connectivity) shaped its abundance pattern. Fragmentation had no effect on the abundance of Chiroxiphia caudata and had a positive effect on Batara cinerea.

Pons, Pere; Wendenburg, Clara				Animal Conservation	8	2		183-193	May 2005	2005							We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity.

Antongiovanni, Marina; Metzger, Jean Paul				Biological Conservation	122	3		441-451	April 2005	2005							The influence of matrix habitats on the occurrence of seven understory insectivorous bird species in forest fragments was examined at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Manaus. Amazonia. Playback techniques were used to detect individuals in the continuous primary forest, fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha, and in two matrix habitat of secondary forest dominated by Vismia spp. and Cecropia spp. Sampling points in secondary forest areas were distributed at 50, 250 and 500 in from the continuous forest. Using G-tests of frequency distribution, species occurrences were compared in the following ways: (a) continuous forest vs. fragments; (b) continuous forest vs. second growth forest; (c) in second growth at different distance, from continuous forest. Species were divided into three categories according to their sensitivity to the fragmentation process. Highly sensitive species (Cyphorhinus arada, Hylophilus ochraceiceps and Thamnomanes ardesiacus) did not occur in small fragments or in matrix habitats. Moderately sensitive species (Formicarius colma and T. caesius) occurred in small fragments and utilized infrequently matrix habitats. Positively affected species (Percnostola rufifrons and Hypocnemis cantator) were frequently detected in small fragments and all matrix habitats. Distances from the continuous forest did not influence the frequency of species occurrences in the secondary forest areas. Species were more frequent in small fragments surrounded by Cecropia spp. than by Vismia spp. Our results support the idea that the maintenance of species in small fragments may depend on their ability to use the matrix, and that increasing the permeability of the matrix may be an option to lessen the effects of forest fragmentation.

Adeyemo, A.I.; Ayodele, I.A.				African Journal of Ecology	43	1		1-6	March 2005	2005							The rock fowl is an endangered species and its food and feeding ecology was studied in the forest zone of Old Oyo National Park, Nigeria. The methods used were direct observation, and fragmentation analysis of faecal and crop content of samples collected during both the wet and dry seasons. The results showed that rock fowl feed on a wide range of species of insects, fruits and flower buds. In the wet season, animal resources represented 54 and 62% of the adult and chick diet, respectively, whereas in the dry season, animal food resources represented about 600% of both adult and the chick diets. There was a significant difference (P 0.05) in the food composition of the birds between the dry and wet seasons. There was also a significant (P 0.05) difference in food preference between adults and chicks. Food sharing was not common, although it was observed between rock fowl cockerels and hens. Food search and selection indices were directly related to season and food availability. It was concluded that food scarcity may not be a serious contributory factor in the threat to the rock fowl.								0141-6707							10.1111/j.1365-2028.2005.00371.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14107040413					J	ZOOR14105030187		Nested species assemblages as a tool to detect sensitivity to forest fragmentation: the case of cloud forest birds.		Martinez-Morales, Miguel Angel				Oikos	108	3		634-642	March 2005	2005							In an ecological community, groups of species may or may not have a nested structure. Furthermore, any nested structure detected could have several causes, each of which would have to be identified, since they may have important theoretical and management implications. In this paper, I assessed the nested structure of bird communities using cloud forest fragments in eastern Mexico to identify bird species and groups of species sensitive to cloud forest fragmentation. Sensitive species were expected to have a nested arrangement highly correlated with forest fragmentation intensity. Analysis identified the following groups of birds as showing a nested structure highly correlated with cloud forest fragmentation: birds with a body mass between 100 and 300 g and larger than 600 g, some trophic behavioural guilds (terrestrial granivore, terrestrial granivore-frugivore, understory granivore-frugivore, arboreal granivore-frugivore, gleaning terrestrial insectivore, gleaning understory insectivore, cliff gleaning insectivore, nocturnal aerial insectivore, diurnal raptor, nocturnal raptor, terrestrial omnivore, scavenger), forest interior and generalist birds, species restricted to cloud forest, and threatened species. This study shows that the analysis of the nested species assemblage can be considered a useful tool to identify species sensitivity to ecological or landscape patterns and processes, in this case, species or groups of species affected by a fragmented landscape pattern.								0030-1299							10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13706.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14105030187					J	ZOOR14108044921		Avian malaria in Brazilian passerine birds: parasitism detected by nested PCR using DNA from stained blood smears.		Ribeiro, S.F.; Sebaio, F.; Branquinho, F.C.S.; Marini, M.A.; Vago, A.R.; Braga, E.M.				Parasitology	130	3		261-267	March 2005	2005							The microscopical examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and a nested PCR were performed to detect avian Plasmodium in 275 passerine birds from small and large fragments of Atlantic Forest, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The 275 blood smears were used both for the microscopical examination and nested PCR providing the DNA template used for the reactions. The sensitivity of the nested PCR assay was higher than that observed for blood smears through microscopical examination. High prevalence (39.6%) of Plasmodium infections was detected by nested PCR while the microscopical examination detected only 16.5% positive birds. Poor agreement was observed between the results of the two different tests. The PCR data obtained were correlated to the forest fragment size of the Atlantic Forest and also correlated to the biological characteristics of the birds (nest type construction, diet, participation in mixed-species flocks, age and sex). Birds captured in the large forest areas were more infected than birds captured in the small areas (51.9% and 28.5%, respectively). Diet and participation in mixed-species flocks were correlated to the Plasmodium parasitism. The insectivorous birds and those that participated in mixed-species flocks were more frequently infected (47% and 41.5%, respectively) than the other groups.

Barbano, Luc; Pontcharraud, Laurent; Vetillard, Fabrice; Guyon, Dominique; Jactel, Herve				Ecoscience	12	1		110-121	2005	2005							We carried out a multi-taxa study to investigate the responses of species assemblages to stand and landscape variables in maritime pine plantation forests in the Landes de Gascogne (southwestern France). Breeding birds, carabid beetles, and ground-dwelling spiders were sampled simultaneously in a balanced set of 27 stands varying in tree species composition, age, and vertical structure. The composition and structure of surrounding landscapes were quantified within a 500-m radius around the stands. Species responses to a combination of 12 stand and landscape variables were estimated using multiple stepwise regression. Bird, carabid, and spider assemblages were related to the same explanatory variables using a set of co-inertia analyses. Tree height was the best predictive variable for all taxa at species richness, species assemblage, and individual species levels. Landscape variables were important as secondary factors, especially landscape fragmentation, spatial heterogeneity, and shape and spatial distribution of deciduous forest patches in the surrounding landscape. The occurrence of deciduous forest patches and an increasing landscape heterogeneity appeared to be beneficial to forest birds and spiders but not to carabids, probably because forest carabids are generally poor dispersers, more sensitive to habitat fragmentation.

Twintig jaar strijd om behoud van het Korhoen op de Sallandse Heuvelrug.	de Bruijn, Onno; Dirks, Paul; ten Den, Paul; Klomphaar, Ton; Veerbeek, Herman				Levende Natuur	106	2		50-57	maart 2005	2005							The Black grouse is a characteristic bird of the edges of heaths and moors where these adjoin grassland and open woodland. The recent serious decrease of the Black grouse in range and numbers in Western-Europe can be attributed to fragmentation and degradation of the breeding habitat (increased abundance of grasses on heaths and the drying out of moors), more efficient and intensive agricultural use of the adjoining farmland, as well as the disturbance caused by increased recreation pressure and the predatory activities of Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). In 2004, only fifteen males were counted at the last remaining site in the Netherlands, the 'Sallandse Heuvelrug' (province of Overijssel). Besides the factors already mentioned, climatic warming with wetter winters and springs has had a negative effect on the Black grouse which is adapted to cold, snowy winters and warm, dry springs. Presently, high chick mortality is a key factor in the decline as a result of a lack of food (insects) and poor weather conditions. In 1991, a Black Grouse Conservation Plan was launched by the Dutch government. In line with this plan, conservation organisations (Natuurmonumenten and Staatsbosbeheer) are structurally improving the grouse's habitat on the Sallandse Heuvelrug. This includes the stimulation of heather regeneration, deforestation and the modification of agricultural practices in the surrounding farmland. Active management (sod-cutting, mowing, woodcutting) is leading to a mosaic heathland with long and short heathers (Calluna vulgaris), patches of Vaccinium vitis-idaea, local Juniperus communis shrubs, and semi-open woodland with Vaccinium myrtillus. Besides this patchwork-type of heathland management, sheep grazing has been stopped, some 300 ha of forest has been felled, and gradual transition zones from heath to woodland are being created. In addition, the predatory losses are kept low by shooting Foxes, and recreation zoning measures have been put in place to restore quiet areas. Unfortunately, so far, the Black Grouse has not seen an increase in numbers from this intensive habitat management. Nevertheless, a breeding population has survived on the Sallandse Heuvelrug, and habitat-use observations show that the grouse are reacting positively to the measures undertaken. Moreover, positive population trends in other characteristic (insectivorous) species of heathland communities are encouraging, in particular Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), Stonechat (Saxicola rubicola), Woodlark (Lulula arborea) as well as the Sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). Over the last years, Natuurmonumenten has reinstated some fields of traditional crops (oats, spurry) and Staatsbosbeheer is acquiring adjoining farmland for future marginal grassland use for the benefit of the Black grouse. Eventually, repopulation of this area with lowland Black grouse (bred in captivity or obtained from abroad) may be an appropriate option once the conditions that led to the population decline have been sufficiently resolved.								0024-1520								ZOOREC:ZOOR14201007933					B	ZOOR14105032310		Life after logging: reconciling wildlife conservation and production forestry in Indonesian Borneo.

The Indonesian government has pledged to do its best to control these problems, a pledge that has been formalized in a range of laws and international agreements. But despite the need for immediate and definitive actions, achieving conservation goals remains fraught with challenges. Part of the problem is that conservation interest has focused on protected and unlogged forest, but we need to recognise that logged forest is a vital component of any comprehensive approach to landscape-scale conservation. Our review focuses on the ecological and life history aspects of Bornean vertebrates and how these relate to forest management, with a specific emphasis on lowland and hill dipterocarp forest. But ecological studies seldom lead to improved forest management practices. Our review provides three responses to this: 1. Recommendations in the research literature are compiled and translated into management implications. These can be presented to those who need to know about them. 2. Knowing that a species declines with forestry interventions is seldom enough to clarify how forestry practices might be adapted (short of a ban) in order to mitigate the negative impacts. We set out to link species sensitivity with ecological and life history correlates to develop a better understanding of why a given taxon is vulnerable, allowing a more species-specific approach to the protection of habitat characteristics and components. 3. Research needs to answer management relevant questions. We identify priority topics for research. Our primary intention is thus to identify and clarify what makes fauna vulnerable to various kinds of forestry-related interventions. Based on these results, insights and related hypotheses, we compile and develop recommendations for improved management practices and identify priorities for future research. We are pragmatic: we acknowledge the critical role of the socio-political context for implementing our proposals. Yet, while various key issues are raised, the pace of change in Indonesia is currently so rapid and the issues so complex that our discussion of this context cannot resolve all the current and future opportunities. We focus, therefore, on technical ecological information, the validity of which is independent of volatile local politics. We found a considerable body of ecological information relevant to the management of tropical forests and their wildlife. Improving current management practices requires collaborations between ecologists and forest managers to develop pragmatic guidance for improved practices. The present review and synthesis is one component in achieving this collaboration, focusing upon the fauna of the Malinau area in East Kalimantan (Indonesia).In Part I of this book we summarize knowledge concerning various forest interventions and how they affect selected wildlife species. We identify a range of effects caused by timber harvesting, and note the associated influences of hunting and forest fragmentation. Additional problems are caused by exotic species, law enforcement, fires and a range of other factors. Yet despite decades of wildlife research on Borneo there is little information on the magnitude and mechanisms of threats to wildlife. Most studies considered in this book report on autecological studies of various species, but do not analyse species characteristics in relation to different threat levels. Still, we are able to draw various conclusions about the effects of timber harvesting and associated factors on wildlife, and provide general management recommendations. Selective logging has fewer direct negative consequences for many vertebrate species than is sometimes assumed. It certainly affects certain groups of species, like terrestrial, insectivorous birds and mammals, which suffer from the reduced ground cover. This may primarily be caused by the slashing of ground cover and lianas, which is currently required by law. Some species, though, such as deer and banteng, appear well adapted to, and can increase in, the more open habitats that follow logging. Timber harvesting generally brings a number of associated problems in addition to the direct disturbance of forest habitat. Two important aspects, from a wildlife conservation perspective, are increased hunting and forest fragmentation. Hunting can pose a considerable threat to some forest fauna and this threat often increases with forestry roads, increased access to forests and the provisioning needs of camps. Improved hunting technologies and increasing availability of guns add to the pressure. Roads, skid trails and degraded areas fragment forest habitats. Small isolated populations, such as those created by fragmented or heavily harvested landscapes, are at much greater risk of various deleterious effects that can ultimately lead to local extinction. Some species have minimum fragment size requirements for population persistence. Recent research has highlighted the importance of maintaining 'forest-like' habitats, or a network of 'forest stepping-stone' habitats in the intervening landscape. The effects seem likely to be worst in forests with excessive road density, wide clearings, and many large deforested openings. Forest edges can generate signifi cant effects on individual, population, and community dynamics in remaining forest areas. Several studies report that the effects of logging can extend considerable distances into surrounding undisturbed forests. In Part II of this book we analyse species in relation to their tolerance to the effects of logging and forest change. Using multivariate analyses we identify various factors associated with bird and mammal species that are vulnerable to logging interventions. These factors are dietary specialization, restricted feeding strata, endemicity, apparent evolutionary age (those that evolved during the Miocene or Early Pliocene) and absence from small islands. Factors which we found not to be significant in our data set are group size, number of young per litter, body weight and home range size. Terrestrial insectivores and frugivores appear particularly sensitive to timber harvest practices, whereas herbivores and omnivores were more tolerant or even benefited from logging. Based on these fi ndings we provide recommendations on forest management for concession managers, local and national governments, in Part III. We support the application of good conservation planning, good road building and reduced impact logging methods. Specific recommendations include the retention of ecologically important habitat structures (large trees, hollow trees, fruiting species) and locations (salt licks, watercourses). In terms of silvicultural practices we recommend that understorey slashing (currently a legal requirement) be discontinued. We recommend regulating hunting in timber concessions; law enforcement authorities and concession managers must be able to control this. Hunting of vulnerable species would ideally be eliminated. It is important to retain a contiguous forest. Where forest areas are broken up by wide-roads, logging and agriculture, forest corridors should be maintained as much as possible to maximize connectivity within the forest matrix. At the concession level, retaining linear forest elements (e.g., riverine forests) as corridors between forest blocks can increase faunal dispersal and thus the chances of species survival in forest patches. Reducing the width of roads and tracks, maintaining canopy connectivity over roads, and limiting felling-gap sizes, should also reduce the effects of fragmentation on arboreal species. In addition to these more general recommendations, we suggest many specific actions that might help the conservation of several specific species. Examples include the need to set aside sufficiently large areas for protected large carnivores (Malayan Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard), retain large dipterocarp trees for Helmeted Hornbill nesting and for Great Slaty Woodpecker feeding, and regulate collection of freshwater turtles. We highlight, amongst other things, how governments can better support wildlife conservation in forestry concessions. The government has the important task of evaluating the list of species presently protected in Indonesia, as many rare and endangered species are missing from the list (e.g., Straw-headed Bulbul). We call for an operational action plan to ensure that clear conservation goals are effectively implemented at the concession level (current requirements, though well-intended, have little impact on management choices). We find several areas where effective biodiversity-friendly forestry management is limited by our lack of knowledge. In Part IV we focus on this and provide research recommendations. While research will continue to contribute to our understanding of how timber harvesting practices and their associated impacts might be refi ned to benefit wildlife conservation, a lack of knowledge cannot be used to justify delay in implementing our main recommendations. We may not yet be in a position to describe and advocate perfect management, but we can definitely propose substantial improvements of current practices.									979-3361-56-5							ZOOREC:ZOOR14105032310					B	ZOOR14110060822		Understanding and conserving tropical diversity: perspectives from Barro Colorado Island.		Leigh, Egbert Giles, Jr; Rubinoff, Ira			Bermingham, Eldredge; Dick, Christopher W.; Moritz, Craig	Tropical rainforests: past, present, and future.				223-250	2005	2005							To understand and maintain tropical forest diversity, we must distinguish different species and learn what factors regulate different populations, how different species coexist, and how different species depend on one another. We must also learn how new species evolve and how different scales of environmental change influence speciation rate, as well as the diversity and species composition of ecological communities. These goals demand diverse approaches and a thorough understanding of natural history. For example, exclusion experiments in intertidal ecology suggest how the consequences of forest fragmentation can reveal the trophic organization of intact rainforest; field experiments with reef fish illustrate trade-offs inferred from the behavior of ant-following birds. Diversity reflects opportunities for coexistence; speciation with secondary overlap depends on the availability of a "niche opportunity." How much diversity a community maintains depends, in turn, on its trophic organization. Thus, high tree diversity may occur only where predators reduce the effect of generalist insect herbivores. The dynamism, trophic organization, and resistance to invaders of a forest ecosystem on a long-isolated land-mass depend on that landmass's area. Ecological communities are organized for high productivity and species diversity, as economies are for high productivity and diversity of occupations. In both, high diversity depends on long freedom from major disruption.									0-226-04468-8							ZOOREC:ZOOR14110060822					J	ZOOR14209057611		Potential effects of large-scale elimination of oaks by red oak borers on breeding Neotropical migrants in the Ozarks.		Smith, Kimberley G.; Stephen, Frederick M.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	191			312-321	2005	2005							The Arkansas Ozarks are currently experiencing an outbreak of the red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), a native insect that has previously not been considered an important forest pest species. As many as 50 percent of the trees in the Ozarks, which has the highest density of oaks in the United States, may be dead by the year 2006. The Ozarks are generally believed to be a source region for Neotropical migratory birds, compared to fragmented areas to the east and north, but that could change very rapidly with the elimination of oaks. The potential impact on migratory breeding birds was assessed, first, by reviewing the impact on birds of other tree species eliminations that have occurred in the eastern United States (American chestnut (Castanea dentate), American elm (Ulmus americana), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and Frazer (Abies fraseri) and Eastern (A. canadensis) firs). Those results were incorporated into our studies on migratory breeding birds in the Arkansas Ozarks. Populations of 11 of 20 migratory species are predicted to decline, and some species, such as the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerula), may be extirpated. Only five forest species are predicted to increase, but at least five early successional species (e.g. Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens)), which are currently absent from upland hardwood forests, should increase with the development of a scrub layer as the canopy opens. Thus, the red oak borer infestation has the potential to greatly alter the composition of the avifauna of the Ozarks, which may have far-reaching implications for many species of neotropical migratory birds.								0196-2094								ZOOREC:ZOOR14209057611					J	ZOOR14101000266		Habitat structure and proximity to forest edge affect the abundance and distribution of forest-dependent birds in tropical coastal forests of southeastern Madagascar.		Watson, James E.M.; Whittaker, Robert J.; Dawson, Terence P.				Biological Conservation	120	3		311-327	December 2004	2004							Despite the fact that Madagascar is classified a biological 'hotspot' due to having both high levels of species endemism and high forest loss, there has been no published research on how Madagascan bird species respond to the creation of a forest edge or to degradation of their habitat. In this study, we examined how forest bird communities and different foraging guilds were affected by patch habitat quality and landscape context (forest core, forest edge and matrix habitat) in the threatened littoral forests of coastal southeastern Madagascar. We quantified habitat use and community composition of birds by conducting 20 point counts in each landscape contextual element in October and November 2002. We found that littoral forest core habitats had significantly (p 0.01) more bird species than forest edge and matrix habitats. Thirty-one (68%) forest dependent species were found to be edge-sensitive. Forest edge sites had fewer species, and a higher representation of common species than forest interior sites. Twenty-nine species were found in the matrix habitat, and the majority of matrix-tolerant forest species had their greatest abundance within littoral forest edge habitats. Guild composition also changed with landscape context. Unlike other tropical studies with which we are familiar, we found that frugivorous species were edge-sensitive while sallying insectivores were edge-preferring. The majority of canopy insectivores (n = 15, 88%), including all six endemic vanga species, were edge-sensitive. When habitat quality was assessed, the distributions of nine edge-sensitive species were significantly (p 0.01) affected by changes in habitat complexity and vegetation vertical structure in core or edge point counts. Therefore, we believe that changes in vegetation structure at the edge of littoral forest remnants may be a key indicator of mechanisms involved in edge sensitivity of forest dependent species in these forests. Our findings indicate that habitat fragmentation and degradation affect Madagascan bird communities and that these processes threaten many species. With continued deforestation and habitat degradation in Madagascar, we predict the further decline of many bird species. [copyright] 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Revista Brasileira de Zoologia	21	4		871-876	dezembro 2004	2004							Although the crab eating fox, Cerdocyon thous (Linnaeus, 1706), is a relatively common Canidae, there isn't much information about its diet and its role as a seed disperser in the different habitats where it occurs. The aim of this work was to report the diet of the C. thous and its importance as a seed disperser and/or a seed predator and to test the rate of germination of the seeds after passing through the digestive tract of the animal. The work was carried out in a 680 ha fragment of the Semidecidual Seasonal Forest in the Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy, located in the city of Londrina-Parana, south of Brazil. The methodology consisted of the collection of excrement of C. thous which were analyzed in laboratory for identification of consumed items and seeds. In germination tests, the seeds were placed to germinate in Petri dishes with wet cotton. Ninety-three animal feces samples, with 219 animal and vegetable items were registered, being 36.52% remaining portions of small rodents, 24.19% of grasses, 13.24% of birds, 10.47% of insects, 6.39% of Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassm., 4.6% of other items of animal origin and 4.54% of items vegetable origin. In addition, C. thous dispersed nine species of plants, with relevant importance to the germination of some seeds, which passed through the digestive tract, except for the most consumed of fruit, S. romanzoffiana, with no seed germination at all in lab conditions. In conclusion, C. thous has a generalistic and opportunistic diet, surviving in degraded and anthropic areas and being able to act as a seed disperser.								0101-8175							10.1590/S0101-81752004000400022	ZOOREC:ZOOR14105029571					J	ZOOR14103016580		Abundance and distribution of raptors in the Sierra de San Javier Biological Park, northwestern Argentina.

The most abundant species were permanent residents that are widely distributed in South America. Species richness was highest among carnivores and lowest among insectivores in the three main habitats of the park, while scavengers were the most abundant functional group in all habitats. We discuss the importance of the park for the conservation of species susceptible to local extinction. The White-rumped Hawk (Buteo leucorrhous) and the Hook-billed Kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus) seem to be at high risk of local extinction because of their decrease in number, susceptibility to forest degradation, and the progressive isolation of the park. Eight species regularly used the habitat where their abundance was highest (King Vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), Short-tailed Hawk (Buteo brachyurus), Barred Forest-Falcon (Micrastur raficollis), and Buff-fronted Owl (Aegolius harrisii) in the mature subtropical montane forest; and White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus), Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and Burrowing Owl (Speotyto cunicularia) in disturbed forests). These species are potentially useful as indicators of habitat quality and in assessing the impact of habitat fragmentation and modification on the park's wildlife.								1075-4377								ZOOREC:ZOOR14103016580					J	ZOOR14102008196		Avifaunal responses to habitat fragmentation in the threatened littoral forests of south-eastern Madagascar.		Watson, James E.M.; Whittaker, Robert J.; Dawson, Terence P.				Journal of Biogeography	31	11		1791-1807	November 2004	2004							Aim. Madagascar's lowland forests are both rich in endemic taxa and considered to be seriously threatened by deforestation and habitat fragmentation. However, very little is known about how these processes affect biodiversity on the island. Herein, we examine how forest bird communities and functional groups have been affected by fragmentation at both patch and landscape scales, by determining relationships between species richness and individual species abundance and patch and landscape mosaic metrics. Location. Littoral forest remnants within south-eastern Madagascar. Methods. We sampled 30 littoral forest remnants in south-eastern Madagascar, within a landscape mosaic dominated by Erica spp. heathland. We quantified bird community composition within remnants of differing size, shape and isolation, by conducting point counts in November-December in 2001 and October-November 2002. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, remnant shape, isolation, and surrounding landscape complexity. We used step-wise regression to test the relationship between bird species richness and landscape structural elements, after correcting for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the landscape variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analysis and binomial logistic regression modelling. Results. Bird species richness and forest-dependent bird species richness were significantly (P < 0.01) explained by remnant area but not by any measure of isolation or landscape complexity. The majority of forest-dependent species had significant relationships with remnant area. Minimum area requirements for area-sensitive species ranged from 15 to 150 ha, with the majority of species having area requirements > 30 ha. Surprisingly, there was no relationship between bird body size and minimum area requirement. Forest-dependent canopy insectivorous species and large canopy frugivorous species were the most sensitive functional groups, with > 90% species sensitivity within each group. The distribution of four forest-dependent species also appeared to be related to remnant shape where remnant area was 100 ha. Main conclusions. The majority of forest-dependent species, including many that are considered widespread and common, were found to have significant relationships with fragment size, indicating that they are sensitive to processes associated with habitat loss and fragmentation. As deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain serious problems on the island, it follows that many forest-dependent bird species will decline in abundance and become locally extinct. At the regional scale, we urge that large (> 200 ha) blocks of littoral forest are awarded protected status to preserve their unique bird community.

Vergara, Pablo M.; Simonetti, Javier A.				Oryx	38	4		383-388	October 2004	2004							Depending on the mosaic of habitats that is created, forest fragmentation can reduce the abundance and diversity of forest birds. Temperate deciduous forests in South America are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations, causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds. We examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas: a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest, forest fragments and pine plantations. Four species were negatively affected by fragmentation, with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations. Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest. The abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve, but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations. Thus, forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology.

Interacciones ecologicas entre ecotparasitos y aves silvestres de fragmentos de bosque y cerrado en Minas Gerais, Brasil.	Rojas-Robles, Rosario				Actualidades Biologicas (Medellin)	26	81		111-124	July 2004	2004							The prevalence of ticks, feather mites and chewing lice was determined in 467 individuals of 67 species of birds from fragments forest and cerrado habitats captured with mist nets at two protected areas in Minas Gerais, Brazil, between March and September of 1997. The feather mites presented the greater value of prevalence (76%), chewing lice and ticks showed low levels of infestation (13 and 15%). The prevalence of ticks on the birds, varied based on the taxonomy and the diet of the hosts species and between forests, when comparing the two areas of study. The prevalence of feather mites varied based on the diet, degree of dependency of forests, participation in mixed flocks, with the type of vegetation (forests and cerrado) and if the hosts birds were captured in the interior or at the edge of the forest. The prevalence of chewing lice changed with the diet, degree of dependency of the forest, participation in mixed flocks and place of the forest in which the hosts birds were collected. This could be explained by the fact that the ticks, chewing lice and feather mites, have different cycles of life, habitats, habits, levels of adaptation, specificity and co-evolution with its hosts. The ectoparasites affect their hosts in a different way, generating tolerance or mechanisms of defense that can reflect different intensities of infestation.								0304-3584								ZOOREC:ZOOR14107041781					J	ZOOR14010058053		Species richness and relative abundance of birds in natural and anthropogenic fragments of Brazilian Atlantic forest.		Dos Anjos, Luiz				Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias	76	2		429-434	June 2004	2004							Bird communities were studied in two types of fragmented habitat of Atlantic forest in the State of Parana, southern Brazil; one consisted of forest fragments that were created as a result of human activities (forest remnants), the other consisted of a set of naturally occurring forest fragments (forest patches). Using quantitative data obtained by the point counts method in 3 forest patches and 3 forest remnants during one year, species richness and relative abundance were compared in those habitats, considering species groups according to their general feeding habits. Insectivores, omnivores, and frugivores presented similar general tendencies in both habitats (decrease of species number with decreasing size and increasing isolation of forest fragment). However, these tendencies were different, when considering the relative abundance data: the trunk insectivores presented the highest value in the smallest patch while the lowest relative abundance was in the smallest remnant. In the naturally fragmented landscape, time permitted that the loss of some species of trunk insectivores be compensated for the increase in abundance of other species. In contrast, the remnants essentially represented newly formed islands that are not yet at equilibrium and where future species losses would make them similar to the patches.

Radford, James Q.; Bennett, Andrew F.				Biological Conservation	117	4		375-391	June 2004	2004							The concept of critical thresholds of habitat loss has recently received considerable attention in conservation biology and landscape ecology, yet empirical examples of thresholds are scarce. Threatened species management could benefit from recognition of thresholds because conditions under which populations are at risk can be specified. In this study, 56 woodland patches in northwest Victoria were surveyed for the white-browed treecreeper Climacteris affinis, a threatened insectivorous bird of the semi-arid zone of southern Australia. Comparisons with historic records indicate the species' range is contracting in Victoria. Using logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning, two models of patch occupancy were developed. Tree species composition was an important factor in both models, confirming the treecreepers' affinity for belah Casuarina pauper and slender cypress-pine Callitris gracilis-buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii woodlands in north-west Victoria. The first model emphasized the importance of demographic isolation: probability of patch occupancy decreased with distance to the nearest occupied patch. A threshold response in demographic isolation was apparent. In agricultural landscapes, most suitable woodland patches within 3 km of an occupied patch were occupied, whereas patches beyond the threshold were vacant. The threshold distance increased to a minimum of 8 km in a matrix of native vegetation, suggesting landscape context affects the response of white-browed treecreepers to habitat fragmentation. Demographic isolation is a quasi-dependent variable and therefore a second model was developed using surrogate variables for demographic isolation. A positive relationship with the proportion of woodland cover in the landscape (100 km2) emerged as the pre-eminent explanatory factor. Depending on woodland quality, a threshold of patch occupancy was apparent at levels of woodland cover between 15 and 25%. However, belah and slender cypress-pine-buloke woodlands now cover only 10% of their original extent in the region. These results highlight the inter-dependence of patch isolation with the amount and quality of habitat in the landscape and the implications this has for maintaining functional connectivity. The retention (or restoration) of suitable habitat is the critical issue for conservation of the white-browed treecreeper, but in landscapes below the threshold of habitat cover, viability of local populations may be influenced by the configuration and quality of remaining habitat.

Donatelli, Reginaldo Jose; da Costa, Thiago Vernaschi Vieira; Ferreira, Carolina Demetrio				Revista Brasileira de Zoologia	21	1		97-114	marco 2004	2004							This paper discusses a qualitative and quantitative survey of the avian community in the Fazenda Rio Claro (22[degree]27[minute]S, 48[degree]51[minute]W), Lencois Paulista, Sao Paulo State. The quantitative survey was conducted in the period August 2001-July 2002 using the Point Counts method. Diversity, frequency of occurrence (FO), abundance and evenness were measured for the community, which was classified into food categories and vertical occupancy of plant strata. The qualitative survey recorded 216 species, 82 of which were non-Passeriformes and 134 Passeriformes. The quantitative survey recorded 74 species and 761 contacts, with an average of 12.7 contacts per sample. The Abundance Index (IPA) varied from 0.001 (one contact) to 0.07 (53 contacts); the Diversity Index was H'=3.10, showing a significant increase between September and November. Evenness averaged 0.95. Insectivores accounted for almost half the total number of species recorded in the quantitative survey (44%), followed by frugivores (24.9%), omnivores (16.4%), carnivores (8.5%), detritivores (1.4%), and a small proportion of nectarivores. Insectivores were the most abundant category in the understory, while frugivores were most abundant in the canopy and on the ground. The bird community of Fazenda Rio Claro is relatively stable, balanced and even in terms of richness, number of species, and IPA. Some endangered species are found in the area.				donatelli, reginaldo/0000-0002-5271-7922				0101-8175							10.1590/S0101-81752004000100017	ZOOREC:ZOOR14008046320					J	ZOOR14102014464		Avian extinctions from tropical and subtropical forests.		Sodhi, Navjot S.; Liow, L.H.; Bazzaz, F.A.				Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics	35			323-345	2004	2004							Tropical forests are being lost at an alarming rate. Studies from various tropical locations report losses of forest birds as possibly direct or indirect results of deforestation. Although it may take a century for all the sensitive species to be extirpated from a site following habitat loss, species with larger or heavier bodies and those foraging on insects, fruits, or both are particularly extinction prone. Larger- or heavier-bodied species may occur at low densities, increasing their vulnerability to habitat alterations. Insectivores are vulnerable for reasons such as the loss of preferred microhabitats, poor dispersal abilities, and/or ground nesting habits that make them susceptible to predation. The lack of year-round availability of fruits may make survival in deforested or fragmented areas difficult for frugivores. Extirpation of large predators, superior competitors, pollinators, and seed dispersers may have repercussions for tropical ecosystem functioning. Large tropical reserves that adequately protect existing forest avifauna are needed. Sound ecological knowledge of tropical forest avifauna for biodiversity-friendly forest management practices is also needed but sorely lacking.

Naka, Luciano Nicolas				Auk	121	1		88-102	January 2004	2004							I analyzed the species composition, structure, and trophic organization of bird assemblages in the forest canopy around Manaus, Brazil. Using three canopy towers located in primary terra firme forests, I conducted 117 censuses over a 13 month period, recording 160 bird species. The three study sites had similar species richness (between 126 and 128 species), sharing 95 species in common, which accounted for >90% of all individual records. Most species recorded in the canopy (110) belonged to the core canopy avifauna. The other 50 species included migrants (13), species that feed overhead (8), species from lower strata (15), night birds (3), and vagrants or visitors from open areas and second-growth forests (11). Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama. I suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the bird community composition in the forest canopy, allowing a higher influx of opportunistic species.

The goal of the study was to test if the degree of isolation of the fragments has a more significant effect than their sizes in changing the guild composition. Point counts were performed in 14 forest fragments (11-656 ha). When separating the fragments by their sizes, a marginally significant discriminant root was obtained in the canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) using the number of species in each guild ([chi]216 = 25.59; P = 0.06). A significant root was also obtained by separating fragments according to their degree of isolation (CDA; [chi]216 = 26.38; P = 0.05). Leaf insectivores were the most important guild for the results in both CDAs. No significant discriminant root was found when considering the abundance data.

Revista Brasileira de Botanica	27	1		193-204	2004	2004							The breeding system and pollination biology of Sabicea cinerea were studied at "Parque Estadual Dois Irmaos", a fragment of Atlantic forest, in Recife, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, from May/1998 to December/2000. Sabicea cinerea is a vine found in the forest border and which produces flowers throughout the year, with the flowering peak occurring in the dry season (September to February). It presents distylous, actinomorphic, tubular flowers, with white petals. Anthesis begins about 5.00 a.m. nectar production continues until 4.00 p.m.; the daily mean average volume was 8.0 [mu]L and sugar concentration 24%, in both floral morphs. Short-styled (thrum) flowers possess larger corolla and pollen grains in relation to the long-styled (pin) flowers, but there are no differences in the amount of grains between the morphs. Two species of hummingbird visited S. cinerea flowers, Phaethornis ruber, the main pollinator, and Amazilia sp., a nectar thief. Several species of Apidae, Anthophoridae and Halictidae bees, Hesperiidae and Nymphalidae butterflies and Syrphidae flies were also observed visiting Sabicea cinerea flowers. The self-incompatibility of the species was verified through experiments of controlled pollination in field; fruit set was observed only in the intermorph crossings. The occurrence of the sporophytic self-incompatibility was confirmed with the analysis of pollen tubes growth in both floral morphs. The efficiency in pollen transfer among the floral morphs is the main and more important function carried out by the pollinators in order to maintain the S. cinerea populations, mainly because it presents an obligatory xenogamous reproductive system.								0100-8404							10.1590/S0100-84042004000100019	ZOOREC:ZOOR14010059028					J	ZOOR14002012646		Bird extinctions in Atlantic forest fragments of the Vicosa region, southeastern Brazil.		Ribon, Romulo; Simon, Jose Eduardo; De Mattos, Geraldo Theodoro				Conservation Biology	17	6		1827-1839	December 2003	2003							We studied the conservation status of Atlantic forest birds in 43 forest fragments ranging in size from 1 to 384 ha in the Vicosa region of southeastern Brazil. We compared data from 15 years of field work with historical records from the region, mainly originating from specimens collected by Joao Moojen during the 1930s. We used published studies associated with museum data and current field work to assess the decline of forest birds during the last 70 years and to relate their disappearance to forest fragmentation and destruction. At least 28 bird species have become locally extinct, 43 are critically endangered, and 25 are vulnerable, representing 60.7% of the original forest bird community known to exist in the region. Vulnerability to fragmentation differed among guilds, forest strata, and endemicity status. Birds that feed on fruit and seeds, and those that feed on insects, were more threatened than omnivores and carnivores. Nectarivorous species were less threatened than other guilds. Moreover, terrestrial and understory birds or birds using only one forest stratum also were more likely to have been threatened. Finally Atlantic forest endemics were more likely to have become extinct than nonendemic species. In general, sensitivity to environmental disturbance at the local level was similar to the predicted vulnerability to regional disturbance derived from the literature. Our results indicate that a serious decline of Atlantic forest birds is underway and that many other species of birds, not previously recognized as threatened, are of conservation concern.								0888-8892							10.1111/j.1523-1739.2003.00377.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR14002012646					J	ZOOR14009049740		Seasonal variation in avian community composition in a high-andean Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest fragment.		Herzog, Sebastian K.; Soria, Rodrigo; Matthysen, Erik				Wilson Bulletin	115	4		438-447	December 2003	2003							We analyzed seasonal variation in avian species richness and relative abundance at the community and guild level during a 13-month period in central Bolivia in an 11-ha patch of Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest, a high-Andean ecosystem that has suffered from extreme anthropogenic fragmentation. Birds were surveyed audio-visually (supplemented with mist net data) and assigned to five relative abundance categories for 2-month survey periods. We recorded 35 core species, including 16 insectivores (46%), 11 frugi-granivores (31%), seven nectarivores (20%), and one carnivore (3%). Core species richness varied from 25 (June-July) to 33 (October-November). Insectivores had a significantly higher proportion of year-round residents (81%) than frugi-granivores (45%) or nectarivores (14%); the same trend was evident with respect to seasonal variation in species richness of each guild. Although most species varied considerably in their relative abundance, no guild showed significant variation in relative abundance scores among survey periods. However, frugi-granivores and nectarivores combined, both of which depend upon plants as food resources, reached a significant minimum in mid-winter (June-July), and the same result was found at the community level. The insectivore guild thus was the most temporally stable both in terms of species richness and abundance. Qualitative observations indicated that the fluctuations in frugi-granivores and nectarivores were related to the availability of food resources.

Evans, Alison M.; Clinton, Peter W.; Allen, Robert B.; Frampton, Chris M.				Forest Ecology and Management	184	1-3		251-262	3 October 2003	2003							Logs have been recognized as being important components of forest ecosystems acting as a reservoir for Carbon, as sites for seedling establishment and as habitat for insects, birds and other wildlife. In this study, red beech (Nothofagus fusca) logs of a similar decay class were selected from an old-growth forest in the South Island of New Zealand, to investigate the influence of log proximity on invertebrate community composition and litter quality. Core samples were taken from the forest floor at 0 m (beneath logs), 1.5 and 2.5 m distances from the logs, and invertebrates were extracted from the litter and fermentation layer using Tullgren funnels. All invertebrates were identified to family level with the exception of Acari (mites), which were identified as recognizable taxonomic units (RTUs). The invertebrate fauna of the litter layer was more diverse than that of the fermentation layer and log proximity affected invertebrate family composition in both the litter and fermentation layers. Of the 79 invertebrate families and 41 RTUs extracted from all core samples, five families and three RTUs differed significantly among the three distances from the logs. In the litter layer Threvid larvae (Diptera) and Phlaeothripidae (Thysanura) significantly increased in abundance with increasing distance from the logs. While Dalodesmidae (Diplopoda), Neobisiidae (Arachnida), Amphinectidae (Arachnida) and mite RTUs O, AB, AM occupying the leaf litter and mite RTU AM occupying the fermentation layer significantly decreased in abundance with increasing distance from the log. The density of litter properties such as leaves, twigs, wood, roots, soil and fragments <2 mm differed significantly between the litter and fermentation layers. The density of wood in samples collected beneath logs was higher than that of samples taken at the other distances. At all distances, the C:N ratio was significantly higher in the litter layer compared with the fermentation layer. The C:N ratio beneath the logs in the fermentation layer was significantly higher than that at the other distances. The results indicate that red beech logs influence litter-dwelling invertebrate communities which has consequences for below-ground processes and has implications for CWD management in production forests.

Hausner, Vera H.; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.				Ecological Applications	13	4		999-1012	August 2003	2003							Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to nonnative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for detecting and monitoring impacts: need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be, consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

Perfecto, Ivette; Mas, Alexandre; Dietsch, Thomas; Vandermeer, John				Biodiversity and Conservation	12	6		1239-1252	June 2003	2003							We compare species richness of birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and ground-foraging ants along a coffee intensification gradient represented by a reduction in the number of species of shade trees and percentage of shade cover in coffee plantations. We sampled the three taxa in the same plots within the same period of time. Two sites were selected in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Within each site four habitat types were selected and within each habitat type four points were randomly selected. The habitat types were forest, rustic coffee, diverse shade coffee, and intensive coffee (low density of shade). We found different responses of the three taxa along the intensification gradient. While ants and butterflies generally decrease in species richness with the decrease of shade cover, birds declined in one site but increased in the other. Ant species richness appears to be more resistant to habitat modification, while butterfly species richness appears to be more sensitive. Bird species richness was correlated with distance from forest fragments but not with habitat type, suggesting that scale and landscape structure may be important for more mobile taxa. For each of these taxa, the rustic plantation was the one that maintained species richness most similar to the forest. We found no correlation between the three taxa, suggesting that none of these taxa are good candidates as surrogates for each other. We discuss the implications of these results for the conservation of biodiversity in coffee plantations, in particular, the importance of distinguishing between different levels of shade, and the possibility that different taxa might be responding to habitat changes at different spatial scales.								0960-3115							10.1023/A:1023039921916	ZOOREC:ZOOR13900042189					J	ZOOR13900053124		Breeding season habitat use and ecology of male northern pygmy-owls.		Giese, Alan R.; Forsman, Eric D.				Journal of Raptor Research	37	2		117-124	June 2003	2003							We examined habitat use, nest location, diet, and activity patterns of radio-marked Northern Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium gnoma) during four breeding seasons (1994-97) in fragmented forests on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. We observed foraging in all available vegetation categories, but patterns of use were non-random. structurally diverse and older forests were most heavily used, openings and patches of saplings received the least use, and use of edge was intermediate. We located eight nests, all in woodpecker cavities in patches of structurally-diverse forest. We found no clear evidence that nests were located near edges. Northern Pygmy-Owls were diurnally active, and male owls delivered food to females during nest establishment and incubation, and to both females and nestlings during brooding. Date of fledging varied from mid June to mid-July. Fledging was synchronous, and minimum estimates of brood size ranged from 1-5. Diet included a mix of small birds, mammals and insects. Our results suggest that the creation of' openings by clear-cut logging is unlikely to benefit Northern Pygmy-Owls, and that the replacement of structurally diverse forests with uniform forests may be detrimental.								0892-1016								ZOOREC:ZOOR13900053124					J	ZOOR13900033085		Woodland fragmentation is causing the decline of species and functional groups of birds in southeastern Australia.		Watson, James; Watson, Alexander; Paull, David; Freudenberger, David				Pacific Conservation Biology	8	4		261-270	March 2003	2003							The clearance of woodlands and the simultaneous creation of alien environments have been identified as the primary reasons for the decline of many woodland birds in southeastern Australia. This study measured how the size of woodland remnants and habitat structural complexity affected bird composition and distribution in the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. Within this region only 8% of the original woodlands remain, embedded as patches in a matrix of pasture and suburbia. Woodland birds were surveyed in 72 woodland remnants of different size and vegetation structural complexity. Avifaunal species richness was found to increase with remnant area and habitat complexity (p < 0.01). Of the 31 resident woodland bird species detected, 22 were significantly affected by woodland patch size reduction and 20 species were significantly affected by habitat complexity loss (p < 0.05). Of the species affected, 19 were affected by both reductions in patch size and vegetation complexity. Seven species (Weebill, Brown Thornbill, Buff-rumped Thornbill, Spotted Pardalote, Grey Shrike-thrush, Scarlet Robin and White-winged Chough) not previously identified as threatened by habitat fragmentation occurred significantly less often in small remnants with low habitat complexity. Assessment of avifaunal guilds based on body size and foraging behaviour showed that all targe species (n = 4) and 85% (n = 17) of insectivorous species that foraged above the ground were statistically affected by patch size and/or loss of habitat complexity. The occurrence of three species (50%) of granivores was also significantly affected (p < 0.05) by patch size and/or habitat complexity reduction. These results show that the distribution of many bird species, including some considered "common" and "widespread", is affected by patch size and habitat complexity. There are few, large complex woodland remnants within the study area, which continue to reduce in size and complexity. It is therefore predicted that the decline of woodland bird species will continue unless appropriate habitat conservation strategies are applied.

Proceedings of the International Symposium 29th-31st May 2003, Mantova (Italy).				23-25	2003	2003							The great spotted woodpecker has to be considered a valuable help in the natural control of the poplar borers, as it can destroy a remarkable amount of xylophagous insects larvae and shows a functional response to the pest density, thus contributing to lower pest populations and to prevent outbreaks. Nests and roost-holes are mostly excavated in dead trees and in snags sizing at least 15 cm in diameter; their preservation in poplar stands is highly recommended, as their presence facilitates the settling of the predator and enhances its efficacy. Moreover, dead wood can host a rich saproxylic fauna which is not harmful to living trees and is more and more threatened in the restricted and fragmented relict riparian woodlands.									88-901223-0-7							ZOOREC:ZOOR14006035647					J	ZOOR14003013846		The proposed Parc Regional de Belomotse: biodiversity survey and conservation evaluation.		Emmett, D.A.; Fanning, E.; Olsson, A.				Frontier Madagascar Environmental Research Report	6			i-xii, 1-103	2003	2003							This report describes the biodiversity survey of the recently demarcated Parc Regional de Belomotse, Toliara Province, Madagascar, conducted as part of the Frontier-Madagascar Forest Research Programme, between July 2001 and September 2002. The Frontier-Madagascar surveys involved a study of the extent and condition of the different vegetation types; vegetation species composition; and the collection of baseline biodiversity and ecological data for mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and other selected invertebrates. Additional studies investigated resource use in the area, and the potential for the development of ecotourism. The surveyed area was, until recently, ungazetted and did not have a formally demarcated boundary. It has now been designated as a proposed Regional Park. Within this area is a core zone, managed through the locally enforced Gestion Locale Securisee (GELOSE). This core area, described for the purposes of this report as the .Sept Lacs region., covers over 3,000 hectares between 40 and 250m asl, approximately 500 hectares of which are riparian forest and wetland habitats. The area surveyed by Frontier-Madagascar extends beyond the locally managed (Sept Lacs) core zone, and also includes a lakeside habitat, Antafoky Lake, and associated areas of riparian forest covering approximately 150 hectares. Thus, the report details surveys of the Sept Lacs region and the Antafoky Lake region, although both sites are contained within the proposed Regional Park. The surveyed area contains approximately 800 inhabitants, distributed through five villages. These inhabitants belong to the Mahafaly, Tandroy and Masikoro tribes. The surveyed area contains many rare species. Four species of mammal, two species of bird and four species of reptile recorded during this survey are classified as vulnerable (IUCN, 2002). Many of the species collected are too poorly studied to be designated IUCN status at this time. Furthermore, several undescribed species were discovered during this survey, including a Blind snake (Typhlops sp.), a pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus sp.) a long-fingered bat (Miniopterus sp), and one butterfly species (Strabena sp.). It is expected that the results of the entomological collections will yield many new species. The riparian forest and wetlands within the Toliara region are threatened with destruction due to clearance or drainage for agricultural purposes. Charcoal production is leading to the loss of many trees of all sizes, and larger trees are logged for the production of pirogues (dugout canoes) or for local burial purposes. Grazing by domestic animals leads to further damage of the disturbed areas. Due to the dry climate, regeneration is slow. Some species will become locally extinct unless the current trend inenvironmental degradation is reversed. The major underlying cause of environmental degradation is the low level of agricultural productivity, obliging local people to exploit natural resources. Supplementary factors are rapid population growth, low educational levels, harmful agricultural methods due to poor soils and techniques, and specific aspects of the Malagasy culture. Ultimately, in order to reduce exploitation of natural resources, living standards of local people must be raised. However, this will take a long time to achieve, and in the short term it is necessary to reduce the rate of environmental degradation by promoting sustainable agriculture and natural resource use, raising awareness about environmental problems, and initiating appropriate forest management schemes. The proposed Regional Park contains some of the most important areas of riparian forest and wetland in southwest Madagascar. However, the remaining areas are becoming fragmented. Habitat destruction within the GELOSE-managed Sept Lacs core zone is occurring at a comparatively low rate, and may be sustainable in the short term. However, this area contains only a small number of wetland habitats, and many of the riparian forests are already degraded and fragmented.The riparian forest around Antafoky Lake is the largest unfragmented area of riparian forest inthe surveyed area. However, this area is suffering from deforestation at an alarming rate and,unless checked, it will be mostly destroyed within three or four years. Also, this lake and theassociated forests contain the highest level of biological diversity found within the proposedRegional Park. All vulnerable species found during the surveys were recorded at this site, as were all but one of the undescribed mammal, reptile and butterfly species. Therefore, it is essential that immediate support be given to this site in order for it to remain a viable and integral part of the Regional Park.

The new panorama of animal evolution: proceedings XVIII International Congress of Zoology.				393-401	2003	2003							The littoral forests of Madagascar resting on sandy soils have been classified as an ecosystem that is distinct from the evergreen eastern rain forests generally growing on lateritic soils. There is no endemic land vertebrate species to the eastern littoral forest. Nevertheless, the vertebrate communities of the littoral forests are distinct from the communities of the eastern rain forest belt. For lemurs, the littoral forest communities represent subsets of the communities in the nearby eastern rain forest. For lipotyphlans, rodents, birds, and amphibians, littoral forest communities are more similar between sites, located several hundred kilometers from one another than to the nearest eastern rain forest site just a few kilometers away. On a functional level, lemur communities of littoral forests contain relatively fewer frugivores but more omnivorous species than eastern rain forests. Among birds, there is a higher percentage of seed-eating and omnivorous species but a lower percentage of insectivorous or vertebrate-eating species in littoral forests than in the eastern rain forest. Littoral forests have a lower percentage of terrestrial rodent species but a higher percentage of terrestrial bird and amphibian species than eastern rain forest sites. For the time being it is unclear whether these differences are due to different resource availability in littoral versus eastern rain forest sites or consequences of unspecified fragmentation effects.									954-642-164-2							ZOOREC:ZOOR14002008136					J	ZOOR13900045630		Consumption of Davilla rugosa (Dilleniaceae) fruits by birds in a cerrado area at Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo State.	Consumo dos frutos de Davilla rugosa (Dilleniaceae) por aves numa area de cerrado em Sao Carlos, Estado de Sao Paulo.	Francisco, Mercival Roberto; Galetti, Mauro				Ararajuba	10	2		193-198	Dezembro 2002	2002							Fruits have bee considered an important feeding resource used not only by frugivorous birds, but also by omnivore and some insectivore species. In the present paper we are reporting the behavior of birds consuming fruits of Davilla rugosa (Dilleniaceae). Handling behavior and visits frequency were analyzed in order to infer about the potential ornithochoric seed dispersal. Focal observations were carried out from October to December 1999 in a cerrado fragment located in Sao Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil (21[degree]58[minute]S, 47[degree]52[minute]W). In 60 h of field work we recorded 241 visits of 13 passerine bird species consuming the fruits. The mean number of visits per hour and the standard deviation were 4.01 [plus or minus] 4.88. All of the species were considere potential seed dispersers, since no pulp mashers or seed predators were observed. No temporal difference in visit frequency was found when all of th species were analyzed together or when they were individually considered. Generalist species were responsible for 68.5% of the visits, followed b frugivorous (22.82%) and insectivorous (8.71%). The main potential seed dispersers were Elaenia spp. (Tyrannidae), Tangara cayana (Emberizidae Empidonomus varius (Tyrannidae), Turdus leucomelas (Muscicapidae) and Vireo chivi (Vireonidae). The high visit frequency observed suggests that D. rugosa fruits may be an important feeding resource for birds in the cerrado ecosystem, in the manner that this plant can be considered in management plans which intent to maintain or rescue bird communities.

Bailey, S.-A.; Haines-Young, R.H.; Watkins, C.				Biological Conservation	108	3		307-316	December 2002	2002							The fragmentation of ancient woodland has been identified as a cause of decline in biodiversity in the UK. Current policy advocates the targeting of resources to mitigate its effects. In this study a number of patch and landscape scale measures of ancient woodland distribution were derived from national data sets. These measures were translated into independent variables representing patterns of woodland cover using principal component analysis (PCA). Key species were selected according to differing sensitivities to fragmentation of ancient woodland. Logistic regression models of species distributions were constructed. A range of bird and mammal distributions were found to be correlated to landscape scale measures of fragment distribution, in contrast to butterfly and plant species, which exhibited a stronger correlation to patch-scale measures. The national distribution of a range of woodland species is predicted. New information is presented on the landscape requirements of woodland species, particularly those that enable them to persist in fragmented woodland landscapes. The different scales at which species show a sensitivity to fragment distribution are discussed. The results confirm the association between species and different aspects of the structure of the wooded landscape, and provide information of value in targeting national conservation expenditure in England.								0006-3207							10.1016/S0006-3207(02)00119-2	ZOOREC:ZOOR13800065935					J	ZOOR13900015779		Nestedness in fragmented landscapes: birds of the box-ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia.		Mac Nally, Ralph; Horrocks, Gregory; Bennett, Andrew F.				Ecography	25	6		651-660	December 2002	2002							Nestedness in biota as a function of species richness - biota of depauperate assemblages being non-random subsets of richer biotas - has been widely documented in recent years (see Wright et al. 1998, Oecologia 113: 1-20). Ordering sites by richness maximizes nestedness indices; however, ordering by other criteria such as area or isolation may be more ecologically interpretable. We surveyed birds in true fragments (35 in all), and in "reference areas" in large extant forest blocks (30 locations), of the same range of areas (10, 20, 40, 80 ha). The avifauna was divided into "bush birds" - species dependent on forest and woodland, and "open country" species. We looked at nestedness in four data sets: "bush birds" in fragments and reference areas, and "all birds" in fragments and in reference areas. All data sets were significantly nested. Ordering by area in all cases was not significantly less nested than ordering by richness. Ordering by area in fragments was significantly greater than in reference areas, but the differences in standardized nestedness indices were small (<15%). We identified those birds that had distributions among fragments that conformed strongly with area, those that were more randomly distributed and some species that were more likely to occupy the smallest fragments. Among the latter was a hyperaggressive, invasive, colonial native species (noisy miner Manorina melanocephala). A suite of small, insectivorous birds was more likely to strongly conform with expected distributions in relation to area, which was consistent with observations of their vulnerability to the effects of the noisy miner in smaller fragments.

Lambert, F.R.; Collar, N.J.				Forktail	18			127-146	August 2002	2002							The lowland forests of the Sundaic region are disappearing at immense speed, and whatever survives of them will inevitably suffer the effects of internal degradation (from logging in particular) and of fragmentation. A review of the various studies of the impact of logging and fragmentation on the avifaunas of forested sites throughout the region consistently indicates that large areas of logged forest retain the majority of species present prior to logging, but that forest fragments - apparently even relatively large patches with a high proportion of primary forest - lose a significant number of species. Of 274 resident forest bird species confined to the lowlands of the Sundaic region (excluding Palawan), 83 (30% of the avifauna) are adversely affected by fragmentation and 26 (9.5%) negatively affected by logging, with forest-interior sallying insectivores, terrestrial insectivores and woodpeckers being particularly susceptible to both threats. In total, available data suggest that at least 91 and possibly 132+ species, or 33-50% of the lowland forest avifauna, respond negatively to the effects of these processes in some parts of their range. In the Sunda region, however, fragmentation would seem to be a much more serious threat to the survival of certain forest bird species than the selective logging of continuous forest. This conclusion suggests that the area of forest estate set aside for the production of timber is likely to have important (albeit secondary) conservation potential if (but only if) strict management regimes eliminate/ minimise fire, further clearance and penetration by settlers and hunters (and possibly only if contiguous areas of primary lowland forest are left intact).								0950-1746								ZOOREC:ZOOR13800061204					J	ZOOR14108048955		Fruit consumption by four woodpecker species (Picidae: Aves) in semideciduous seasonal forest remnants of south Brazil.		Mickich, Sandra Bos				Arquivos de Ciencias Veterinarias e Zoologia da UNIPAR	5	2		177-186	jul-dez 2002	2002							The present study, conducted between 1990 and 1997 in two Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragments in the State of Parana, south Brazil, examined the fruit consumption by four species of Picidae (Melanerpes flavifrons, Veniliornis spilogaster, Colaptes melanochloros and Celeus flavescens). The diet of these woodpeckers was evaluated by two complementary methods: visual records and faecal analysis. Forty-one visual records and 23 faecal samples were obtained; from the faecal samples more than half contained seeds in variable amounts (1 to 100) of up to three fruit species. Thirteen plant species were consumed and their characteristics are presented and discussed. On the contrary of what was expected, fruit consumption was higher during the period of less availability of this resource in the study areas, i.e., from October to March. Since this is the period when most birds breed and also the peak of insects availability, fruit consumption is discussed in terms of nutrients and energetic balance, especially for nestlings. Data on the capture of these species are presented in detail with the objective to stimulate other studies that may contribute to the better understanding of the biology of neotropical picids.								1415-8167								ZOOREC:ZOOR14108048955					J	ZOOR13900010933		Description of a nest of the lesser woodcreeper (Lepidocolaptes fuscus: Dendrocolaptidae) from northeast Minas Gerais, Brazil, with some data about diet and natal pterylosis.

The nest was at 1m from the ground, within a hole in a tree (Mimosoideae). The nest opening was 75 cm high, with a maximum width of 3.6 cm, and with an egg chamber lined with small pieces of bark. The nest had two nestlings weighting 8.0 and 10.1 g. Analyses of the stomachal contents of the two nestlings and of an adult caught in mist nets reveal'ed the ingestion of insects and spiders. The larger nestling had more feathers than the smaller nestling, indicating that the nestlings do not leave the nest with complete feather development. Data of brood patch and cloacal protuberance indicate that the species reproduces in Minas Gerais during the rainy season, between September and December.								0103-5657								ZOOREC:ZOOR13900010933					J	ZOOR13800025977		Disappearance of insectivorous birds from tropical forest fragments.

A study of the Eastern Arc Mountains.		Newmark, W.D.				Ecological Studies	155			i-xii, 1-197	2002	2002							The Eastern Arc Mountains are for their size, biologically the richest site in Tanzania and Kenya. Yet, what is particularly striking about the Eastern Arc Mountains is the unusually high number of endemic plant and animal species. The Eastern Arc Mountains and adjacent coastal forests have the highest known ratio of endemic plant and animal species to area of any site worldwide. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, more than three quarters of the original 20,300 km2 of natural forest has been lost and much of this loss has occurred over the last 200 years. The remaining forest is highly fragmented with most fragments being small - the median forest patch size is 11.5 km2. Currently, natural forest cover in the Eastern Arc Mountains is approximately 5708 km2, of which 1452 km2 is closed forest. In Tanzania and Kenya, populations and demand for arable land are increasing rapidly and human pressures on the Eastern Arc forests will almost certainly increase in the future. As a result of the unusually high concentration of endemic species, the significant loss in forest cover, and the many threats facing these forests, the Eastern Arc Mountains and adjacent coastal forests have been identified as one of the 25 most globally threatened ecosystems or biodiversity "hotspots". A continuing loss of natural forest in the Eastern Arc Mountains would adversely affect local communities, because residents use many forest plant and animal species as food, medicines, building materials, and fuel. The Eastern Arc forests also provide many important regional benefits including the maintenance of water quality, the reduction in soil erosion, the storage and sequestering of carbon, the generation of foreign exchange and employment through forest product utilization and nature-based tourism, and provision of educational and research opportunities for national and international scientists and students. Many of these latter ecosystem services are, however, not adequately valued because they are not included in the market system. The most immediate threats to biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains are deforestation, forest fragmentation, forest degradation, over-exploitation of species, and exotic invasives. Past deforestation and fragmentation in the Eastern Arc Mountains has resulted in the documented local extinction of many understory bird species and the global extinction of a tree species. Based upon species-area relationships, the loss of 76 % of the original forest cover in the Eastern Arc Mountains implies that approximately 30 % of the original plant and animal species found in these forests have become extinct or are in jeopardy of future extinction. Moderate to heavy levels of logging have has been shown in many forests in Africa to adversely affect many primate and bird species as well as alter small mammal and plant communities. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, forest degradation resulting from selective logging and pole cutting has significantly reduced, in disturbed sites, the relative abundance of selected bird guilds, specifically ground-feeding insectivores. Over-exploitation threatens selected plant and animal species in the Eastern Arc Mountains. The Tanzanian government has banned the harvesting of 15 tree species that grow in the Eastern Arc Mountains because of past over-exploitation. Studies in Kenyan coastal forests have shown that the current offtake by local hunters of many large forest mammal species is unsustainable. Similar patterns of exploitation of large mammals most likely exist in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Exotic plants and animals represent a further threat to biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Many exotic plant species have naturalized Eastern Arc forests. In the East Usambara Mountains, Maesopsis eminii, an exotic invasive tree species, has altered the local ecology of many sites. The Eastern Arc forests are probably highly susceptible to exotic invasives because of their highly isolated nature. The most immediate threat in the future to the conservation of biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains maybe fire. With the expansion of small-scale agriculture in the Eastern Arc Mountains, the incidence of fire spreading from agricultural lands into the forest will almost certainly increase. Global warming and climatic change could further facilitate an increase in the incidence of fire. Biogeographic patterns of plant and animal species diversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains have important implications for conservation. In Eastern Arc forests, montane bird species richness is positively correlated with closed forest area while the number of endemic bird species is positively correlated with precipitation. Montane bird species richness is also positively correlated with precipitation, after accounting for closed forest area. On many mountains in the tropics, species diversity is highest at mid-elevation. In the Usambara Mountains, the number of plant and bird species as well as the number of plant species endemic to the Usambara Mountains are highest at mid-elevation and decline at lower and higher elevations. Precipitation is also highest at mid-elevation here suggesting that plant and animal species diversity along elevational gradients in the Usambara Mountains are influenced by patterns of productivity. A mid-elevational peak in species diversity is not, however, universal in the Eastern Arc Mountains. In the Udzungwa Mountains, linypiid spider diversity is highest at high elevations and lowest at mid-elevations. This unusual pattern, however, is most likely a result of area effects. Reducing human pressures on the remaining natural forest and enhancing protected area management and coverage is central to conserving biodiversity in the Eastern Arc Mountains. Improving agricultural practices and expanding fuelwood and hardwood plantations in the Eastern Arc Mountains are activities that can greatly reduce human pressures on forests and forest resources. Furthermore, upgrading the management capacity of protected area institutions in the Eastern Arc Mountains can greatly assist in resolving many local community-protected area conflicts. Given the small size of the Eastern Arc forests, the remaining non-protected forest on public lands in the Eastern Arc Mountains should be given protected area status. Additionally, because of the highly fragmented nature of the Eastern Arc forests, ecological connectivity between the largest remaining fragments should be enhanced through the establishment of wild-life corridors in selected areas.								0070-8356								ZOOREC:ZOOR14007042186					J	ZOOR13900013086		Nested patterns of species distribution and winter flock occurrence of insectivorous birds in a fragmented landscape.		Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban				Ecoscience	9	4		450-458	2002	2002							The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether the probabilities of aggregating in flocks are dependent on the patterns of species distribution across the landscape. I analyzed winter species distribution and flock occurrence (flock formation in a given fragment) at the community and individual species levels of a guild of small insectivorous birds in a fragmented landscape. Species distributed following a nested pattern, which was mainly affected by fragment size. Flock occurrence (single- plus mixed-species flocks) followed a nested pattern, such that the probability of joining flocks was affected by the distribution of species across the landscape. However, when analyzed separately, single-species flock occurrence showed a nested pattern, but mixed-species flock occurrence followed a random pattern. Fragment size and total bird density (as an indicator of the availability of individuals to join flocks) accounted for nestedness. At the individual species level, conspecific and heterospecific densities were the foremost factors increasing flock occurrence probabilities, suggesting that species tended to aggregate when there was an increase in the local availability of individuals. Fragment size and habitat structure (coniferous cover and number of thick trees) also increased flock occurrence, likely because of higher resource availability, which allowed the colonization of more species and individuals. Greater isolation reduced flock occurrence, maybe as a result of lower availability of individuals in distant fragments. Overall, fragmentation conditions can disrupt flocking behaviour of small insectivorous species, which could decrease survival and increase predation risk during winter.								1195-6860							10.1080/11956860.2002.11682733	ZOOREC:ZOOR13900013086					J	ZOOR13900030618		Composition and structure of avian mixed-species flocks in a high-Andean Polylepis forest in Bolivia.		Herzog, Sebastian K.; Soria A., Rodrigo; Troncoso J., Alejandra; Matthysen, Erik				Ecotropica	8	2		133-143	2002	2002							We determined the composition and organization of avian mixed-species foraging flocks during the non-breeding season from April to August 2000 in a high-Andean forest fragment of Polylepis besseri (Rosaceae) (3710-3880 m a.s.l., 11 ha) in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Forest birds were color-banded monthly starting December 1999. Sixty-three observations of flocks were made containing a total of 10 species with a mean ([plus or minus] SD) of 2.8 [plus or minus] 0.9 species and 5.4 [plus or minus] 1.8 individuals per flock. The entire Polylepis bird community contained 30 core species. Since the forest was small, most flocks contained at least some of the same individuals. Three species occurred in > 70% (Giant Conebill Oreomanes fraseri Tawny Tit-Spine-tail Leptasthenura yanacensis, and White-throated Tyrannulet Mecocerculus leucophrys, with 2.6 [plus or minus] 0.6, 1.9 [plus or minus] 0.6, and 1.6 [plus or minus] 0.5 individuals per flock respectively), one species (Asthenes dorbignyi with 1.4 [plus or minus] 0.5 individuals per flock) in 21%, and the remaining six species in [pound sterling] 5% of all flocks. All flock participants except one were insectivores. Individuals of O. fraseri showed high intraspecific group or pair fidelity and often, but not always, acted as flock leader, whereas the sentinel role was mainly assumed by L. yanacensis or A. dorbignyi. For the three species regularly associated with mixed-species flocks, home ranges of banded individuals observed in flocks were determined. Mean home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons) were 6.13 [plus or minus] 0.87 ha for O. fraseri (n = 4), 2.13 [plus or minus] 1.26 ha for L. yanacensis (n = 6), and 3.41 [plus or minus] 2.73 ha for M. leucophrys (n = 3). Intraspecific home range overlap was moderate to high in all species, clear associations of Tawny Tit-Spinetail and White-throated Tyrannulet individuals with one of the two Giant Conebill pairs/groups were lacking, and agonistic interactions were almost absent except in August. In other words, neither individuals nor flocks were territorial, and flocks were much more loosely structured than those studied in Neotropical lowlands, resembling in some respects mixed-species flocks in northern temperate zones. Selective advantages of mixed flocks in Polylepis forests are briefly discussed, finding support only for the predation avoidance hypothesis.								0949-3026								ZOOREC:ZOOR13900030618					J	ZOOR13800017351		Food items found in regurgitation samples of Pyriglena leucoptera (Vieillot) (Aves, Thamnophilidae) in a secondary forest area in Rio de Janeiro State, southeastern Brazil.

Eeley, Harriet A.C.; Lawes, Michael J.; Reyers, Belinda				Biodiversity and Conservation	10	8		1221-1246	August 2001	2001							Southern Africa's subtropical forest biome, though small and highly fragmented, supports much of the region's biodiversity. With limited resources available for conservation and the exploitative use of forest escalating, identifying a network of priority forest reserves is important. We examine the distribution of forest birds, butterflies and mammals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Using an iterative algorithm we explore the efficiency of existing protected areas, species richness and rarity hotspots, prime forest sites (selected by forest area) and complementary networks as alternative approaches to priority reserve selection, as well as the potential use of 'indicator' taxa. Existing protected areas represent 98% of species but are relatively inefficient in terms of area. Alternative selection criteria represent a high proportion of species (86-92%) and provide efficient bases for developing fully representative reserve networks. All species are represented within a network of 22 complementary quarter degree cells. This network includes several larger forests and existing protected areas and is recommended for priority conservation. Complementary networks identified separately for birds, butterflies and mammals overlap little, but each represents a high proportion of the remaining taxa, supporting their potential as representative 'indicator' taxa. The evolutionary history of the three main forest types in KwaZulu-Natal explains observed spatial patterns of alternative reserve networks. Priority areas are concentrated in scarp and coastal forest belts, regions of comparatively recent evolutionary activity with high species richness. Afromontane forest is older and less diverse, but its inclusion in any reserve network is necessary for the full representation of forest diversity.

Caceres, Nilton C.; Monteiro-Filho, Emygdio L.A.				Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment	36	2		85-92	August 2001	2001							Relationships between food habits, home range and activity of the black-eared opossum, Didelphis aurita (Marsupialia, Didelphidae), were studied in an urban forest fragment (5 ha) of southern Brazil from February 1995 to January 1996. Captures were performed weekly using 30 live-traps placed uniformly in the study area. Diet was determined through faecal analysis, home ranges were calculated through the Minimum Convex Polygon method and the activity period was assessed from the time of captures in the night. The opossum proved to be an insectivorous-omnivorous marsupial consuming invertebrates (100%), fruits (78%) and vertebrates (59%). Birds, mammals, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Opiliones and Solanaceous fruits were the main items consumed. Opossums foraged during the first hours of the night in part synchronizing their activity with that of small mammals occasionally preyed upon. Home ranges measured from 0.2 ha for a female to 3.0 ha for a male. Males appeared in the study area only during the wet season, increasing their home range size, whereas females revealed quite exclusive home ranges that could imply the defence of a territory.

Borgella, Rene, Jr; Snow, Allison A.; Gavin, Thomas A.				Biotropica	33	1		90-109	March 2001	2001							In many areas of the humid tropics, relatively small patches of forest is the habitat most commonly available for forest-dwelling organisms. To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited [>]13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.								0006-3606							10.1111/j.1744-7429.2001.tb00160.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR13700042910					J	ZOOR13700023563		Effect of natural and anthropogenic landscape matrices on the abundance of subandean bird species.		Renjifo, Luis Miguel				Ecological Applications	11	1		14-31	February 2001	2001							The nature of the landscape matrix can control the capacity of forest organisms to move among forest patches. Some matrices may constitute foraging or breeding habitat and, as a result, could influence the local abundance of forest organisms and their persistence in fragmented landscapes. This study represents a first approach to examining the effect of natural vs. anthropogenic landscape matrices on the abundance of neotropical birds in forest sites. The influence of three contrasting matrices on the relative abundance of 113 birds species in a subandean region was evaluated. Species were grouped into categories showing the same response to the matrix, and these groups were then examined to determine whether ecological characteristics or taxonomic affinities were associated with responses to surrounding matrices. The abundance of individual species in forest plots within a continuous forest matrix was compared with their abundance in forest fragments embedded in pastures or exotic-tree plantations. The matrix surrounding forest areas was a major factor influencing bird abundance: 65.5% of the species showed significant differences in abundance among sites surrounded by different matrices. The most important explanatory factors in the variation in abundance within fragments were: abundance within continuous forest, presence in the anthropogenic matrices, migratory strategy, and habitat association. Species with small geographic ranges and species of terrestrial insectivores had low tolerance to fragmentation. Responses were highly species specific and largely independent of foraging strata, trophic group, and taxonomic affinities. Several lines of evidence indicate an increased connectivity among forest remnants surrounded by exotic-tree plantations compared to pastures. Landscape supplementation by the exotic-tree plantation matrix was observed for a hummingbird species. These results suggest that structurally complex anthropogenic matrices have potential as management tools for bird conservation by complementing habitat protection and restoration.

Ford, Hugh A.; Barrett, Geoffrey W.; Saunders, Denis A.; Recher, Harry F.				Biological Conservation	97	1		71-88	January 2001	2001							This paper reviews the reasons why so many species of birds have declined in the eucalypt woodlands and associated habitats across the agricultural zone of southern Australia. The extent of habitat lost, over 90% in some regions, has led to the local extinction of some bird species, simply through random sampling effects. Habitat specialists and those that move sequentially among several habitats, are especially at risk, as some habitats have been lost disproportionally. Fragmentation introduces additional problems by subdividing populations into small, isolated sub-populations. Whereas some of the remaining species of birds appear able to move through highly fragmented landscapes, it is possible that they suffer high mortality while doing so. Some species that have been lost regionally may have had difficulty dispersing, but there have been few detailed studies of the demography of Australian birds in fragmented landscapes. Such studies are necessary before we can assess the value of corridors, or other means, to assist dispersal of birds. Fragmentation also leads to edge effects, which, when compounded by habitat degradation, may alter the intensity of a number of ecological processes. There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that loss of nest sites and increased predation on nests and free-living birds have contributed to the decline of woodland birds. Increased interspecific competition, for instance with noisy miners Manorina melanocephala, may also have a major impact on smaller insectivores and honeyeaters. Effects of parasites and disease have barely been studied in Australia, though brood parasitism could account for local losses. Dieback of eucalypts and loss of understorey are common in fragmented and degraded landscapes and are associated with a greatly reduced diversity of birds. The effect of fragmentation and degradation on food has received minimal attention. We propose further research that tests the importance of some of these ecological processes in causing the decline and loss of bird species in agricultural woodlands. Although management should proceed immediately, including a cessation of any further clearing of native vegetation, it should be conducted in conjunction with research. We suggest how the findings of research can inform managers, which will make management more effective in achieving conservation of regional avifaunas.

Van Wilgenburg, Steve L.; Mazerolle, Daniel F.; Hobson, Keith A.				Ecoscience	8	4		454-461	2001	2001							The effects of anthropogenic edges on leaf-litter and shrub arthropods were examined in both agriculture and forestry-dominated landscapes in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Microclimate, vegetation, and shrub and leaf-litter arthropods were sampled at south-facing forest edges and interiors of three sites within each landscapes. Forest edges in the agricultural landscape were older and had vegetation structures that differed from those in the forestry landscape. This resulted in a sharper contrast in microclimate (temperature and humidity) between edge and interior in forests abutting agriculture than in stands abutting recent clearcuts. Arthropods from the leaf-litter and shrub-layer samples exhibited different responses to edges. In both landscapes, total shrub-arthropod abundance was not significantly affected by edges, while total leaf-litter arthropod abundance was lower at edges than in forest interiors. This reduced abundance of leaf-litter arthropods could negatively affect birds and other insectivorous vertebrates or could have been caused by greater vertebrate predation there. Forest edges in agriculture and forestry landscapes represent relative extremes in edge maturity, demonstrating that age of edges cannot completely mitigate edge effects on microclimate and abundance of arthropods. We discuss the implications of our findings for influences of forest fragmentation and landscape change on forest birds.

Anciaes, M.; Marini, M.A.				Journal of Applied Ecology	37	6		1013-1028	December 2000	2000							1. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to the difference between the right and left sides in characters that should otherwise be bilaterally symmetrical, but whose expression is affected by epigenetic stress during development. Forest fragmentation may promote an increase in FA in isolated populations, by either genetic or environmental stress. FA may function as a biomonitor index in conservation biology if increased levels were observed in populations from fragmented habitats. 2. We tested the hypothesis that FA is higher in birds from small tropical forest patches than in large forest tracts. We measured wing and tarsus FA on mist-netted birds from seven fragments and seven continuous areas from south-eastern Atlantic rain forest in Brazil. We performed FA comparisons between fragments and control groups for the whole community, for individual foraging guilds and for the six most abundant species. 3. Wing and tarsus FA were significantly greater in fragments than continuous areas for the whole community and were both negatively correlated with forest fragment size. Differences in FA varied among foraging guilds, being more evident for insectivorous species, especially those feeding in or near the understorey. 4. FA levels increased significantly in forest fragments in at least one trait for five of the six most abundant species. There was no correlation between tarsus and wing asymmetries for the individuals of any species nor any difference between the degree of asymmetries of these characters. 5. We suggest that FA is a useful tool to assess the effects of fragmentation on forest birds, and may be applied in monitoring neotropical birds. FA indices might be profitably developed, particularly in species most threatened by fragmentation effects and when investigated in different morphological characters.

Zanette, Liana; Doyle, Paul; Tremont, Steve M.				Ecology (Washington D C)	81	6		1654-1666	June 2000	2000							Many forest-interior songbirds are considered "area sensitive" because they are absent from smaller forest remnants in fragmented landscapes. Reductions in food abundance with fragment size could explain area sensitivity, but to date, only one empirical study has investigated this possibility. From 1995 to 1997, we tested the food abundance hypothesis in two small (apprx55-ha) and two large (>400-ha) forest fragments located in a matrix of agricultural land in northeastern New South Wales, Australia. We measured differences in food abundance by comparing the biomass of surface-dwelling invertebrates in large and small fragments. We also determined whether food supply was associated with foraging efficiency and reproductive performance in an area-sensitive, ground-foraging insectivore, the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis), breeding at these same sites. Invertebrate biomass in the small fragments was about half of that in the large fragments. Incubating female robins received 40% less food from males, females left their nests more frequently to forage on their own, and nestlings were provisioned with less food in the small fragments. Females in the small fragments also had a shorter breeding season (by three weeks), laid eggs that were 7% lighter, and reared smaller nestlings. Because our measures of invertebrate biomass, foraging efficiency, and reproduction produced corresponding results, we conclude that Eastern Yellow Robins experienced relative food shortage in these small fragments. Therefore, food shortage probably influences area sensitivity in this species. We suggest that the role of food supply be given greater consideration in other fragmentation studies.								0012-9658							10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1654:FSISFE]2.0.CO;2	ZOOREC:ZOOR13600090811					J	ZOOR13600064957		Edge effects on the understory bird community in a logged forest in Uganda.

Conservation Biology	14	1		265-276	February 2000	2000							Understanding how the fauna of logged tropical rainforests responds to fragmentation and the creation of edges is vital to ensure conservation of biodiversity. We studied the composition of the understory bird community from the edge of a 15-ha clearing toward the interior of the forest in apart of Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, that was selectively logged about 45 years ago. Mist netting was conducted along five transects from the edge and 500 m into the interior. The total number of individuals captured did not change with distance from the edge, but there was a significant increase in the number of species. We sampled fewer, but more common species near the edge, whereas the interior of the forest had more, and less common species. Guild composition also changed with distance from the edge. Frugivore-insectivores and nectarivores were most common close to the edge. Among insectivores, ground foragers, bark-gleaners, and leaf-gleaners were most common in the interior of the forest, whereas sallying insectivores favored the edge. Graminivores were unaffected by the edge. Analysis of common species showed that Ispidina picta, Andropadus curvirostris, A. latirostris, Camaroptera brachyura, Terpsiphone rufiventer, and Nectarinia olivacea were associated with the edge, but no species showed significant avoidance of the edge. This finding may be explained by the generally low sample sizes of interior species. Our results show that even bird communities in logged forests respond to edges. Estimates of edge effects suggested that changes in bird densities may have occurred several hundred meters from the edge. In conclusion, logged forests provide habitat for bird species avoiding forest edges, and this should be considered in the management of such forests for conservation.

We used long-term (up to 19-year) studies of four animal groups in central Amazonia to test whether species' abundances in the matrix were correlated with their relative extinction proneness in forest fragments. The four groups, birds, frogs, small mammals, and ants, had varying overall responses to fragmentation: species richness of small mammals and frogs increased after fragment isolation, whereas that of birds and ants decreased. For all four groups, a high proportion of nominally primary-forest species were detected in matrix habitats, with 8-25% of species in each group found exclusively in the matrix. The three vertebrate groups (birds, small mammals, frogs) exhibited positive and significant correlations between matrix abundance and vulnerability to fragmentation, suggesting that species that avoid the matrix tend to decline or disappear in fragments, while those that tolerate or exploit the matrix often remain stable or increase. These results highlight the importance of the matrix in the dynamics and composition of vertebrate communities in tropical forest remnants, and have important implications for the management of fragmented landscapes.

Stratford, Jeffrey A.; Stouffer, Philip C.				Conservation Biology	13	6		1416-1423	December 1999	1999							We examined the distributions of nine species of terrestrial insectivorous birds in 4- to 14-year-old rainforest fragments north of Manaus, Brazil. We surveyed 11 fragments of 1, 10, and 100 ha, 95 ha of secondary vegetation, and nine continuous forest plots (controls) of 1-100 ha. We augmented standard spot-mapping with extensive playback surveys. The fragments had been sampled with mist nets before isolation, so our results could be compared with the pre-isolation distribution. For the nine species, there were 55 cases of local extinction in the 11 fragments between about 1 year after isolation and the time of our surveys. This corresponds to 74% extinction of the local populations in fragments. These extinctions occurred despite the second-growth connection of some fragments to continuous forest as little as 70 m away. Three apparent colonization events by species not detected before isolation also occurred, but these may also reflect inadequate sampling before isolation. Our comparison of fragments and similar-sized control plots in continuous forest showed an area effect on species richness in both fragments and control plots, but fragments had fewer species than control plots of equal size. In a fragmented Amazonian landscape, the full suite of terrestrial insectivores would persist in the short term only in large fragments (>100 ha), although much larger areas are probably necessary for the long-term persistence of their populations.

Grant, Todd A.; Berkey, Gordon B.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	27	4		904-914	Winter 1999	1999							Aspen (Populus spp.) woodland is increasing within native grasslands in north-central North Dakota, and this increase concerns land managers. We examined avian associations in aspen groves of various sizes on and near J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge in 1995-96 to predict how bird communities change as woody plant cover increases within a grassland-dominated landscape. Avian species richness increased as aspen grove size increased, particularly for bird species classified as forest interior, neotropical migrant, ground nesting, or insectivorous. Large (i.e., >100-ha) aspen groves provided suitable habitat for 12 area-sensitive species while also meeting the requirements of more ubiquitous habitat generalists. Conversely, small aspen groves did not support the number or diversity of avian species and were occupied by edge-associated species. None of 53 species recorded in the study were restricted to small aspen groves. We conclude that limiting the spread of aspen woodland into native grassland and eliminating small (i.e., <5-ha) aspen groves where feasible will not adversely impact woodland breeding bird communities. Many avian species occur with greater frequency in aspen woodlands than in eastern deciduous forest. Large woodlands contribute to local avian diversity and may provide habitat for forest species that have shown regional or continental population declines.								0091-7648								ZOOREC:ZOOR13600081297					J	ZOOR13600029861		Composition changes in a subandean avifauna after long-term forest fragmentation.		Renjifo, Luis Miguel				Conservation Biology	13	5		1124-1139	October 1999	1999							Current understanding of the effects of forest fragmentation is based largely on studies in temperate regions, Australia, and Neotropical lowlands. In contrast, the consequences of anthropogenic forest fragmentation for Andean avifaunas are poorly understood, despite large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation. I assessed the effects of long-term fragmentation on a subandean avifauna in Colombia by comparing the occurrence of bird species in forest fragments isolated over 50-90 years with the original avifauna. Prefragmentation bird composition was based on historical records and current species composition in continuous forest. The original avifauna had approximately 139 forest species and 45 species of open habitats. Among forest species, 30% were currently extinct in fragmented forest and 4% were regionally extinct. At least 23 nonforest species colonized the region from the lowlands following deforestation. Species with small geographic ranges and those that were locally scarce or rare throughout their ranges were likely to be locally extinct. Forest raptors, terrestrial insectivores, and large frugivores were highly extinction prone, whereas nectarivores, small frugivores, and aerial insectivores were highly resilient; other guilds were intermediate. Antbirds (Formicariidae, Thamnophilidae), Cotingas, and, especially, Icterids were highly extinction prone. Large body size was not a determinant of vulnerability except among frugivores. Sixty-two percent of the species of special conservation concern were extinct in fragments. These results suggest that only large forest tracts will ensure the survival of a large proportion of subandean avifaunas. Fragments of mature forest, however, may support a diverse avifauna, including small populations of globally endangered species several decades after isolation. These fragments could play an important role in the restoration of local avifaunas.

Aleixo, Alexandre				Condor	101	3		537-548	August 1999	1999							I evaluated the effects of selective logging upon a bird community in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Two areas 500 m apart were selected for quantitative (point censuses) avian surveys: a non-fragmented primary forest (PF) and a selectively logged forest (LF). Six of eight quantitative measures of vegetation structure compared between PF and LF were reduced at LF. Indices of avian species richness and diversity were very similar between PF and LF sites; species composition, however, differed strongly. Although the composition of guilds remained largely the same, most guilds differed in membership between PF and LF in at least one species. Understory and terrestrial insectivores were the most sensitive ecological groups (with most species missing in LF), as also observed in the process of forest fragmentation in other parts of the Neotropics. Based on the results of this study, I recommend the following procedures to minimize adverse effects of selective logging on bird communities in the Atlantic forest: (1) logged areas should be close enough to unfragmented, unlogged forests to allow recolonization of some species, (2) the exploitation of the forest should be carried out using as few roads and as little mechanized equipment as possible, and (3) long-term rotation should be used in areas designed for logging to allow time for forest regeneration.

Round, Philip D.; Brockelman, Warren Y.				Natural History Bulletin of the Siam Society	46	2		171-196	Winter 1998	1998							The bird community in a disturbed mature forest was compared with that found in secondary forest and a regenerating clearing. The mature forest sample areas had only slightly higher species richness, but relatively greater diversity as measured by Fisher's alpha index of diversity. The commonest species were relatively more abundant in the secondary forest and clearings than in mature forest habitat. The secondary forest nevertheless was still rich in bird species, supporting some nationally or internationally threatened species including terrestrial insectivores such as Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi and Large Wren-Babbler Napothera macrodactyla. However, specialist frugivores such as pigeons, Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis and Asian Fairy Bluebird Irena puella and some arboreal insectivores such as malkohas, woodpeckers and Malacopteron babblers, were much less frequent in the secondary forest than in the tall forest. Secondary forest and clearing were similar in the overwhelming abundance of a few species of bulbuls which were generalist insectivore-frugivores. Patches of secondary or degraded forest outside the margins of parks or sanctuaries may offer the only option for the expansion of protection into the lowland forest biome since there is virtually no mature forest left in the Thai lowlands. More work needs to be done to judge the conservation attributes of the smaller and more isolated forest fragments.								0080-9462								ZOOREC:ZOOR13600028011					J	ZOOR13500034798		Biodiversity in Ramogi Hill, Kenya, and its evolutionary significance.		Bagine, Richard K.N.				African Journal of Ecology	36	3		251-263	September 1998	1998							The bulk of Kenyan forests are in the afromontane biogeographical region, but the Lake Victoria basin and its biota have been referred to by many biogeographers as an eastern fragment of the Guineo-congolian forest. The Ramogi Hill forest in the lake basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 400 mm. Although much of its biota is typical of the Guineo-congolian region, several species of insects, birds, mammals and plants have been known to occur in the lowland forests of the Kenyan coast. The presence of taxa in these forests has been attributed to past geological changes and climatic fluctuations during the pleistocene period. Migration and dispersal of taxa have been suggested to have been through Kenya Rift or via the southern route of Rukwa Rift. The biodiversity studies conducted indicate that Ramogi Hill has low animal diversity compared to other forests. However, the importance of Ramogi Hill may be linked to its biological resources, and cultural and religious values accrued by the surrounding local communities. The preservation of Ramogi Hill as a reference point for biodiversity and sacred sites will depend a lot on the influence and participation of communities in biodiversity conservation and management programmes.								0141-6707							10.1046/j.1365-2028.1998.00143.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR13500034798					J	ZOOR13500024621		Island biogeography and the reproductive ecology of great tits Parus major.		Wiggins, David A.; Moller, Anders Pape; Sorensen, Martin Fyhn Lykke; Brand, L. Arriana				Oecologia (Berlin)	115	4		478-482	July 1998	1998							Island biogeography theory has contributed greatly to both theoretical and applied studies of conservation biology (e.g., design of nature reserves, minimum viable population sizes, extinction risk) and community composition. However, little theoretical and empirical work has addressed how island isolation and size affect reproductive ecology. We investigated the reproductive ecology of great tits (Parus major) on one offshore and one nearshore island, as well as on the Danish mainland. Tits breeding on the offshore island bred later, laid smaller clutches, and laid larger eggs than those on the nearshore island and mainland. In addition, the level of ectoparasite infestation in nests was highest on the offshore island, intermediate on the nearshore island, and lowest on the mainland. These insular effects may occur due to lower food abundance on islands, to density-dependent effects, or to effects related to low genetic diversity within island populations. Whatever the cause, the results emphasize that future studies of forest fragmentation/population isolation should consider not only gross measures of reproductive success, but also fine-scale measures such as clutch size, timing of breeding, and parasite prevalence.

Grey, Merilyn J.; Clarke, Michael F.; Loyn, Richard H.				Pacific Conservation Biology	4	1		55-69	May 1998	1998							The abundance of an aggressive Australian honeyeater, the Noisy Minor Manorina melanocephala, was reduced at four small (<8 ha) Grey Box Eucalyptus microcarpa woodland remnants by experimental removal. The diversity and abundance of small insectivorous and nectarivorous birds increased at three of the four sites (relative to matching control sites) over the twelve months following the removal of the Noisy Miners. The one exception occurred at a pair of sites where eucalypts began flowering at one site and finished at the other during the Noisy Miner removal period. These results, taken together with those from three earlier experiments where the abundance of Noisy Miners was reduced in Mugga Ironbark E. Sideroxylon woodland remnants, demonstrate that Noisy Miners affect avian diversity and abundance by aggressive exclusion of other species. In five out of seven experiments, Noisy Miners did not reinvade the small woodland remnants during the ensuing twelve months. When Noisy Miner abundance was reduced, increased populations of small insectivorous and nectarivorous birds used small degraded woodland remnants. Colonizing populations of small birds have the potential to reduce insect infestations and may assist in the recovery of dieback-affected woodland remnants. Research is continuing to test this hypothesis. Reducing the abundance of Noisy Miners in remnant eucalypt woodlands may also be a useful, short-term measure, which could assist in the recovery of threatened or endangered bird species.

Christiansen, Mette Bohn; Pitter, Elin				Biological Conservation	80	1		23-32	April 1997	1997							Patterns of species loss and decline in a forest bird community following deforestation near Lagoa Santa, Brazil, were examined in three forest fragments during 1987. Records of 107 species were compared with those collected by Lund and Reinhardt (Reinhardt, J. (1870). Vidensk. medd. Dansk Nat.-hist. Foren., 22, 1-124, 315-457). Thirteen forest species recorded in the last century were not found in the same area in 1987. Some of these species were previously common. Species loss was related to fragment size; thus, in fragments of 24, 63 and 198 ha, we found 20, 29 and 34 forest species, respectively. The more diverse community of the original forest has been replaced by a community strongly dominated by a few species, at least four of which apparently were uncommon in the last century. Species that had increased in the area were small forest birds that feed on small insects in the understorey. Those that declined included species with specialized food requirements or feeding behaviour and species at the limit of their distributional range.								0006-3207							10.1016/S0006-3207(96)00073-0	ZOOREC:ZOOR13300056149					J	ZOOR13400043311		Preliminary observations on the role of coffee plantations as avifaunal refuges in the Palni Hills of the western Ghats.		Shahabuddin, Ghazala				Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society	94	1		10-21	April 1997	1997							A preliminary study was undertaken to explore the role of coffee plantations as a refuge for the avifauna of fragmented forest patches in the middle Palnis of the Western Ghats. This was done by systematic observations using the line transect method in 6 one-hectare plantation plots and 3 forest plots in 2 valleys. Species composition, species richness and feeding guild abundances were compared between the two habitat types using non-parametric tests. Species composition of avifauna was found to be significantly different between forest and plantation plots. Several native forestloving species were not observed foraging in plantations. The insectivorous guild was found to be more often sighted in forest habitat, while the omnivorous guild was found to be more abundant in the plantation habitat. However, the plantation habitat appeared to be a valuable secondary habitat for the foraging of a large subset of forest-dwelling species and may possibly be an effective buffer between fragmented forest habitat patches in this area. These are very preliminary trends for the season of study and need to be followed up with long-term detailed studies, both to confirm the trends observed in this study and to find out the modifications in agricultural practices, if any, needed to maximise the avifaunal conservation potential of coffee plantations in the middle Palnis.								0006-6982								ZOOREC:ZOOR13400043311					J	ZOOR13300061500		Seasonal and interannual occupation of a forest archipelago by insectivorous passerines.		Telleria, J.L.; Santos, T.				Oikos	78	2		239-248	March 1997	1997							The distribution of insectivorous passerines was studied in 31 fragments (0.1 to 350 ha) of a holm oak (Quercus ilex) Mediterranean forest archipelago in central Spain for two consecutive springs and winters (1988 to 1990). The study aimed to assess the role of forest size, abundance and other biological traits (nesting site and foraging substrata) of the species in their ability to occupy the fragments. The number of fragments occupied by the species (fi) was correlated to their abundance (di) in spring and winter. Spring-to-winter changes of di correlated positively to changes off due to the incidence of summer migrants but failed to show any significant pattern when restricted to species occurring in both seasons. The between-winter variations of di correlated positively with changes in fi, while the between-spring changes of both parameters did not correlate, probably because of stronger effects of site fidelity on bird distribution in this period. Between-year persistence in the occupation of fragments was directly related to bird species abundance and, for a given abundance, persistence decreased in the smallest fragments. Hole-nesting species during the 1988 spring and the exploiters of scarce trees or foraging substrata during both winters showed an apparent restriction to colonize the smaller fragments due in part to changes in habitat structure related to fragmentation. These results support the hypothesis that abundance is a good predictor of the ability of species to occupy and persist in fragments. However, abundance alone does not fully explain the processes that determine these occupancy patterns, since other traits related to the spatial scale of analysis and the suitability of fragments for each bird species are also involved.

The Treecreeper occurred in 14 out of 18 forest fragments while the Nuthatch was only observed in seven, mainly in fragments exceeding 4 ha. We found no effect of forest size on any of the components of the foraging niches of either Treecreeper or Nuthatch, and Treecreeper foraging niches did not become broader in the smaller fragments in which Nuthatches were absent. The significant niche change we did observe was opposite to the expected direction. We conclude that winter foraging niches of small insectivorous birds do not necessarily expand in the absence of close competitors in island-like situations.

Daily, Gretchen C.; Ehrlich, Paul R.				Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	93	21		11709-11712	October 15 1996	1996							Surveys of butterfly and moth diversity in tropical forest fragments suggest that nocturnality confers a dispersal, and possibly a survival, advantage. The butterfly faunas of smaller fragments were depauperate; in contrast, the species richness of nocturnal moths was similar in all fragments and even in pasture. The lack of correlation between butterfly and moth species richness among fragments (r-2 = 0.005) is best explained by movements of moths at night when ambient conditions in forest and pasture are most similar; butterflies face substantial daytime temperature, humidity, and solar radiation barriers. This interpretation is supported by information on birds, beetles, and bats.								0027-8424							10.1073/pnas.93.21.11709	ZOOREC:ZOOR13300037669	8876201				J	ZOOR13300005593		Use of Amazonian forest fragments by understory insectivorous birds.		Stouffer, Philip C.; Bierregaard, Richard O., Jr				Ecology (Washington D C)	76	8		2429-2445	December 1995	1995							We sampled understory insectivorous birds in Amazonian forest fragments from before isolation through 9 yr after isolation. We accumulated 3658 mist net captures of 84 insectivorous species in five 1-ha fragments and four 10-ha fragments. Abundance and species richness declined dramatically after isolation, even though fragments were separated from continuous forest by only 70-650 m. Three species of obligate army ant followers disappeared within the first 2 yr after isolation. Mixed-species flocks containing 13 commonly netted species disintegrated within 2-3 yr after isolation, although three species that dropped out of flocks persisted in fragments. Among insectivores not associated with flocks or army ants, only two species of edge specialists were unaffected by fragmentation. Overall, loss of forest insectivores was not compensated for by an increase in nonforest or previously uncommon species. Secondary vegetation surrounding fragments strongly affected use of fragments after isolation. Fragments surrounded by Vismia, the dominant regrowth where felled forest was burned and temporarily used as cattle pasture, remained depauperate. In contrast, many species returned to fragments by moving through regenerating forest dominated by Cecropia, which occurred in areas where the felled forest was not burned. Both 1- and 10-ha fragments surrounded by Cecropia were used by ant followers by 5 yr after isolation. Mixed-species flocks reassembled in 10-ha fragments surrounded by Cecropia by 7-9 yr after isolation, and augmented their group territories by foraging in secondary forest outside fragments. Solitary species were more variable in their responses, although several species returned to 10-ha fragments surrounded by Cecropia. Terrestrial insectivores, such as Sclerurus leafscrapers and various antbirds, did not return to any fragments, and appear to be the group most vulnerable to fragmentation.

Stouffer, Philip C.; Bierregaard, Richard O., Jr				Conservation Biology	9	5		1085-1094	October 1995	1995							We sampled understory hummingbirds in Amazonian forest fragments from before isolation through nine years after isolation. We recorded 377 captures of eight species in five 1-ha fragments and four 10-ha fragments. The three species netted before isolation, Phaethornis superciliosus, Phaethornis bourcieri, and Thalurania furcata, were nearly equally abundant at that time. After isolation abundance of P. bourcieri and T. furcata did not change, but P. superciliosus became nearly twice as common. Five additional species that were netted only after isolation represented about 10% of the post-isolation sample. The species recorded only after isolation were forest species usually found above the levels of nets; fragments were not colonized by nonforest species. Use of fragments did not differ between 1- and 10-ha fragments. The landscape surrounding the fragments included active cattle pasture, abandoned pasture, and Cecropia-dominated second growth, but this variation had little effect on use of fragments by hummingbirds. The results suggest that these understory hummingbirds can persist in a matrix of fragments, secondary growth, and large forest patches. This response is much different than that of the insectivorous birds that dominate the understory bird community at the site, which are much more vulnerable to fragmentation.

Seitz, Alfred				Verhandlungen der Deutschen Zoologischen Gesellschaft	88	2		61-76	1995	1995							Animal populations are structured in space and time by discontinuities of their environment. In Central Europe, the Pleistocene glaciation separated populations in their Mediterranean refugia, and after the recolonisation, human activities caused further, increasing fragmentation. The local, partially isolated sub-populations are connected via gene flow. The genetic structures of the populations are therefore caused by two basic processes: random genetic drift and exchanger of genes. The amount of gene flow can be estimated by the degree of genetic differentiation of the subpopulations. Various methods exist that allow the analysis of the genetic polymorphism of populations on the level of proteins (enzyme electrophoresis) or DNA (DNA- fingerprinting, RAPD, DNAsequencing). These methods are suited for study of small-scale or global variation. By means of three examples, the population genetical analysis of natural populations is shown and the realisation of theoretical concepts demonstrated. In the first, the effect of repeated foundation of populations in the course of the recolonisation of Central Europe is shown by the tephritid fly Urophora cardui. The amphipod Gammarus fossarum is used to demonstrate (a) the effect of one-dimensional gene flow within a small-scale river system and (b) one possible outcome of long-term separation of populations in different Pleistocene refugia. Finally, the limited gene flow within an isolated population of the tree creeper (Certhia brachydactyla) is demonstrated by the analysis of DNA-similarity of individuals. This analysis shows the possibility of the estimation of the species dependent minimum size of a biotope. The application of gene flow studies in evolutionary biology and conservation biology is discussed as a possible means of assessing historic events of colonisation and low levels of dispersal.								0070-4342								ZOOREC:ZOOR13300049916					J	ZOOR13100024364		Movements of single birds and mixed-species flocks between isolated fragments of cloud forest in Ecuador.		Poulsen, Bent Otto				Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment	29	3		149-160	September 1994	1994							Movements of birds between isolated fragments of cloud forest at 2900-3000 m were studied in southern Ecuador. Twenty-nine (38%) of the diurnal forest-bird species moved over clear-cut areas between isolated fragments 35-110 m apart. They ranged from the 6 g Black-throated Tody-Tyrant (Hemitriccus granadensis) to the gt 800 g Bearded Guan (Penelope barbata). The frugivorous Great Thrush (Turdus fuscater) made 48% of all movements between the fragments. The Great Thrush excluded, frugivorous birds still moved more frequently between fragments than insectivorous and omnivorous birds; edge-canopy birds moved more frequently between fragments than interior and edge-canopy-interior birds. Species gtoreq 15 g moved more frequently between fragments than smaller species. The majority of movement, occurred between fragments of tall forest and small distance (65-80 m) apart compared to fragments of low forest and greater distance (80-100 m). Three mixed-species flocks were present in the study area. The largest flock (21 species, 49-54 individuals) roamed over a continuous tract of forest and contributed individuals to one of the other flocks (11-12 species, 24-25 individuals), which used a fragmented home-range of minimum 6-7 ha. Front time to time the latter flock separated into smaller units. Within the home area mixed species flocks were observed more frequently in tall forest (75.8%) than in low forest.								0165-0521							10.1080/01650529409360927	ZOOREC:ZOOR13100024364					J	ZOOR13200005537		Invasion of the savage honeyeaters.

In 1911, 128 forest bird species were present in San Antonio. Twenty-four species had disappeared by 1959, and since then 16 more species have gone locally extinct, for a total of 40 species or 31% of the original avifauna We analyzed patterns of extinction in relation to geographic distribution and foraging guilds. We found that in this montane assemblage, being at the limits of the altitudinal distribution was the main correlate of extinction; 37% of the extinct species were at the upper limit of their altitudinal distribution. We also found that the most vulnerable guilds were the understory insectivores and the large canopy frugivores. Our study illustrates the extent of bird extinctions that are currently undocumented in the highly fragmented forests of the northern Andes, where the absence of baseline information on the fauna of unaltered forests is a limiting factor for the development of conservation and management plans.

The results confirmed that a total of 84 species of bird nested in them. The breeding avifauna included: a group of species tolerant of small woods with areas of several hectares or less and a group of species which only occurred in medium-sized woods. The species occurring in the large forests of eastern Poland and not reported in the woods studied may be defined in general as birds of the forest landscape. For the various groups of forest bird, mean values for minimum forest area (MFA) were calculated, along with values for the threshold of regular presence in the bird community (TRP). These allowed it to be stated that different groups of species are vulnerable to forest fragmentation to varying degrees. Most vulnerable were species in the following groups: true residents, hole-nesters, herbivorous birds, birds feeding on vertebrates and insectivorous birds which form mixed feeding flocks in the forests of this region in winter. It emerged that the species least sensitive to forest fragmentation were omnivorous birds, the remaining insectivorous birds, ground-nesters, birds nesting in the crowns of trees and bushes, and non-residents. Significant differences in vulnerability to forest fragmentation were not noted for species foraging both in tree stands and beyond the forest.								0001-6454								ZOOREC:ZOOR13100032372					B	ZOOR13100067174		Habitat edges and restoration: methods for quantifying edge effects and predicting the results of restoration efforts.

Wauer, Roland H.; Wunderle, Joseph M., Jr				Wilson Bulletin	104	4		656-673	December 1992	1992							Bird populations were sampled along road transects eight months after Hurricane Hugo struck St. Croix (West Indies) at sites previously sampled on similar dates in 1987. Surveys revealed 33 species both before and after the hurricane, of which 30 species were detected during both samples. However, the average number of birds per stop was significantly lower after the storm's passage than before. No pattern was evident in the changes of aquatic species, but this may reflect limited sample sizes. Among terrestrial species, higher proportions of nectarivores and fruit/seedeaters declined than insectivores or raptors, suggesting that the storm's greatest stress occurred after its passage rather than during its impact. Populations of the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) declined on one transect and increased on another, a pattern consistent with inter-habitat migration. The fruit/seed diet, low population size, and restriction to remnant forest fragments of the Bridled Quail-Dove (Geotrygon mystacea) may explain the significant population decline of this species and its disappearance from traditional sites.								0043-5643								ZOOREC:ZOOR13000015305					J	ZOOR12700011330		The persistence of ant-following birds in small Amazonian forest fragments.

Platt, A.P.				Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington	89	4		633-645	1987	1987							The various forms of butterflies comprising the Limenitis arthemis-astyanax complex are reviewed and their genetic relationships established. Suggestions are made for distinguishing forms albofasciata Newcomb and proserpina Edwards. The species status of arhemis and astyanax is reviewed from an historical perspective. The occurrence of handed butterflies (forms arthemis and albofasciata) at Green Ridge State Forest in western Maryland is documented. Hardy-Weinberg analyses demonstrate that the observed and expected numbers of banded, partially banded, and unbanded insects closely approximate each other in three consecutive annual samples (1982-84) and in the total sample as well (n = 586). Analyses of "beak tear" frequencies among quantitative samples of banded, partially banded, and unbanded butterflies in the UMBC and Milwaukee Public Museum Collections, suggest that bird predation is an important factor driving the evolution of the disruptively banded and unbanded mimetic wing patterns north and south of the blend zone, respectively. Within the blend zone, similar data suggest that selection is "relaxed." Wing fragments obtained from 47 suggest that localized predation can be quite heavy, with a single bird consuming an average of 11 butterflies per day.								0013-8797								ZOOREC:ZOOR12400034822					J	ZOOR12300046474		Effects of forest succession and fragmentation on bird communities and invertebrates in boreal forests.

Roberts, J.T.; Heithaus, E.R.				Ecology (Washington D C)	67	4		1046-1051	1986	1986							We studied the secondary movements of Ficus hondurensis seeds after their initial dispersal by vertebrates in Santa Rosa National Park Costa Rica. Common vertebrate consumers of figs were various birds, bats, coatis, white-faced monkeys, and ctenosaurs. The ants Pheidole radoszkowskii, P. fallax, and Atta cephalotes were common secondary dispersers. Ants removed 25.2 to 97.7% of the seeds placed randomly in 275 groups (N = 13,700 seeds). Rodents did not attack these seeds. Ants removed seeds from vertebrate feces, but were more likely to remove seeds from fruit fragments. Ants found and depleted seed groups more rapidly in a late-successional forest site than under the fruiting tree. Some fig seeds that were discarded by ants germinated, indicating that such secondary movements of seeds may be beneficial to the parent plant.								0012-9658							10.2307/1939827	ZOOREC:ZOOR12300034669					B	ZOOR12500008372		Forest fragmentation in the Amazon: a case study.

Muell. in central Victoria.		Ashton, D.H.				Australian Journal of Ecology	4	3		265-277	1979	1979							In an unburnt, mature forest the germination of E. regnans on undisturbed bare ground is very poor in spite of adequate seed fall and the presence of conditions suitable for germination over much of the year. No seed storage occurs in the top soil in spite of some temporary seed dormancy and the disturbance of the surface soil by earthworms and lyre birds. Seed is removed from the top soil by several ant species (Prolasius pallidus, P. brunneus, P. flavicornis and Chelaner leae), and is taken into nests. The seed is eaten and not stored for any length of time. The testae may be left intact, fragmented or molded into crumbs with other material. Certain sugar-like substances, which are extractable in low concentrations from fresh seed, may be involved in the attractivity of seed to ants. The numbers of ant species in the forests vary with the micro-climate of the site, and in the mature understorey of Pomaderris aspera the activities of the 3 dominant species Iridomyrmex biconvexus, P. pallidus and P. brunneus are largely separated diurnally, seasonally and spatially in the foraging areas of the litter layer. The total number of ants probably exceed 5-6 million/ha and is probably sufficient to effectively remove 60% of the sporadic seed fall of normal years. The success of germination of E. regnans after wild fires is probably not due to any specific stimulation but rather to a temporary interference of ant foraging activity and then to the saturation of their food requirements by a massive seed fall from canopy-stored capsules.								0307-692X							10.1111/j.1442-9993.1979.tb01218.x	ZOOREC:ZOOR11600026895					J	ZOOR11600042833		Foods of feral house cats (Felis catus L.) in forest of the Orongorongo Valley, Wellington.		Fitzgerald, B.M.; Karl, B.J.				New Zealand Journal of Zoology	6	1		107-126	1979	1979							The foods of feral house cats in the forest in the Orongorongo Valley were studied over 3 yr and related to the availability of prey. Some cats were trapped, tagged and released, and could be identified individually by coat color and pattern. The number of cats, estimated from live-trapping and sightings, was stable during the study. Examination of 677 scats revealed that mammals (rat, rabbit, opossum, mouse and stoat, in descending order of importance) formed the bulk of the diet by weight. Remains of birds occurred in 12% of scats, but birds were estimated to form only 4.5% by weight of the diet. Insect fragments were present in many scats; wetas (Orthoptera), cicadas (Hemiptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) were important seasonally. Although eaten in large numbers, they contributed very little by weight to the diet. Populations of rats, rabbits and opossums were fairly stable during the study; mice were abundant for most of the first 18 mo., but were scarce in the last year. The literature on the food habits of feral house cats is reviewed: It emphasizes that cats are primarily predators of small mammals (rodents and lagomorphs). Predation by feral cats can be important in holding rat and rabbit populations at low densities and in reducing seasonal fluctuations in their numbers. Cats can also exert heavy predation pressure on low-density mouse populations. Although the cats now eat few birds, they may have been responsible for reducing the numbers of some forest birds in the past.								0301-4223								ZOOREC:ZOOR11600042833
