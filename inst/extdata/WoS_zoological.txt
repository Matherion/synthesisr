Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimesfire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species' environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes.

Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km2 in 2015 and 0.626birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

Tarbill, Gina L.; White, Angela M.; Manley, Patricia N.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	13	1		16	Jun 2018	2018				English	3	3	The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging.

Tremblay, Junior A.; Boulanger, Yan; Cyr, Dominic; Taylor, Anthony R.; Price, David T.; St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues				PLoS ONE	13	2		e0191645	Feb 7 2018	2018				English	7	26	Many studies project future bird ranges by relying on correlative species distribution models. Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and standlevel processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape-and stand-scale processes (referred to as "drivers of change") were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts.

Avian Conservation and Ecology	12	2		15	Dec 2017	2017				English	0	6	A major challenge for protected areas is providing wildlife with enough suitable habitat to cope with stochastic environment and increased pressure from the surrounding landscapes. In this study, we addressed changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile. We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2% in Conguillio National Park, but increasing by 34.3% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers responded to forest conditions within each park such that their abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern Chile.

Versluijs, Martijn; Eggers, Sonke; Hjalten, Joakim; Lofroth, Therese; Roberge, Jean-Michel				Forest Ecology and Management	401			75-88	Oct 1 2017	2017				English	7	65	Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.

Wiebe, Karen L.				Journal of Avian Biology	48	3		431-438	Mar 2017	2017				English	2	10	Woodpeckers are considered ecosystem engineers because they excavate tree cavities which are used subsequently by many species of secondary cavity nesters for breeding. Woodpeckers have the choice of excavating a new hole or reusing an existing one, and this propensity to excavate (e) may affect community dynamics but has rarely been investigated. Using 18 years of data on a population of northern flickers Colaptes auratus, I tested six hypotheses to explain the propensity to excavate (e) in a landscape which experienced two types of disturbance: pine beetles and wildfires. Woodpecker age, breeding experience and mate retention had little influence on e which varied between 13-39% annually and averaged 23% for 1843 first nests over the 18 yr. Body size and body condition of males and females were not associated with e but rates of excavation declined seasonally, suggesting time rather than energy costs limited excavation effort. Reduced cavity availability mediated through high conspecific density coupled with wildfires triggered relatively high excavation rates, up to 39% but e decreased to baseline levels three years after the landscape disturbances. Nearly 2/3 of males did not excavate in their lifetime but apparently, e is great enough to balance the average rate of cavity tree loss in this forest which is 11% annually. Excavation propensity in flickers is flexible, but the birds reduce their work levels if there is a surplus of holes available.

Darracq, Andrea K.; Boone, Wesley W.; McCleery, Robert A.				Forest Ecology and Management	378			214-221	Oct 15 2016	2016				English	16	141	A clear understanding of how management influences vertebrate biodiversity is critical for the conservation of rare ecosystems, such as the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in the southeastern United States: We used scientific literature to assess how vertebrate use of the longleaf pine ecosystem (High or low) differed in response to high (1-3 years), moderate (>3-5 years), and low (>5 years) burn frequencies. For all species combined, we found that the number of high use (HU) species associated with moderately burned forests (n = 140) was 22% and 33% greater than in high (n = 115) and low burn (n = 105) frequency forests, respectively. This pattern was most clear for Ayes and Reptilia. Specifically, the number of HU species associated with moderate burn frequencies (Aves - n = 69; Reptilia - n = 36) was 21% and 25% greater for Ayes and 56 and 63% greater for Reptilia than high (Ayes - n = 57; Reptilia - n = 23) and low burn frequencies (Ayes - n = 55; Reptilia - n = 22), respectively. We found no difference in the number of HU species across burn frequencies for Amphibia or Mammalia. For species considered longleaf pine specialists, across all vertebrate taxa the number of HU species was associated with areas of high and moderate burn frequencies. We posit that moderate burn frequencies had the greatest number of HU species because of requirements for multiple habitat types, structural diversity, and habitat components that are reduced in, or not provided by, areas with high burn frequencies. If conservation of specific longleaf pine specialists that rely on habitat created by high fire frequencies (e.g. Red-cockaded woodpeckers) is the objective, we suggest managing with high burn frequencies at the local scale. Conversely, if management objectives include maximizing wildlife diversity, managers should use a more variable fire regime across the landscape, from annual to less frequent 5 year burn intervals, to maintain localized patches of oaks and increase the compositional and structural diversity within the system.

Tingley, Morgan W.; Wilkerson, Robert L.; Howell, Christine A.; Siegel, Rodney B.				Methods in Ecology and Evolution	7	5		508-517	May 2016	2016				English	1	28	1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. 2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. 3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. 4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

Lorenz, Teresa J.; Vierling, Kerri T.; Kozma, Jeffrey M.; Millard, Janet E.				Forest Ecology and Management	363			110-119	Mar 1 2016	2016				English	2	49	Information on the foraging ecology of animals is important for conservation and management, particularly for keystone species whose presence affects ecosystem health. We examined foraging by an at-risk cavity excavator, the white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus). The foraging needs of this species are used to inform management of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in some areas of western North America. Past observational studies indicated that white-headed woodpeckers forage predominately on cones and trunks of large-diameter (>68 cm) pines in old-growth stands, although habitat selection while foraging has not been formally examined. We used radio telemetry to track forage substrate use among 37 adult, breeding woodpeckers for 176 h (10,576 min) in forest stands that had been recently thinned and/or burned with prescribed fire. We used discrete choice models to examine forage site selection and multinomial regression to examine consequences of foraging on nest productivity. Woodpeckers foraged on more than ten individual substrates and switched substrates seasonally, presumably to take advantage of prey availability. Dead wood and fir foliage were used commonly in the nesting period (86% and 68% of foraging, respectively), whereas pine foliage and trunk foraging dominated in the fledgling (66% of foraging) and post-fledgling periods (73% of foraging). Average size of used trees was 49 cm ([plus or minus]20 cm) and pine cones were rarely used (4% of foraging). During the nesting period, substrate use ([chi]2 = 1.49, df = 4, P = 0.83) and distances traveled from nests for foraging did not affect productivity (F(3,16) = 0.61, P = 0.62), which was high even for birds with the longest (2.1 km) and shortest (0.39 km) maximum forage distances. Habitats selected for foraging matched substrate use, and woodpeckers selected areas with low basal areas of live trees in the nesting period, but high basal areas in the post-nesting period. The variable foraging that we observed suggests that white-headed woodpeckers are plastic in their foraging in managed forests, and this plasticity has no negative consequences for productivity.

Tremblay, Junior A.; Ibarzabal, Jacques; Saulnier, Marie-Christine; Wilson, Scott				Ornis Hungarica	24	1		69-80	2016	2016				English	0	1	Nest care is an important parental contribution to offspring. In woodpeckers, males often have an equal or greater contribution to parental care, including nest sanitation. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a North American boreal woodpecker for which both parents are highly involved in parental care. By modifying their territory size in optimal and suboptimal habitat (e.g. burned vs unburned habitats), this species seems to have a large tolerance to variation in prey abundance at a landscape scale, and could provide a useful biological model to investigate the adaptability of parent care, particularly to relative contribution of each sex. We investigated sex- and habitat-specific parental care behaviour of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 9 nests by daily monitoring during the nestling period. Specifically, we examined two different aspects of parental care: 1) time spent at the nest, and 2) food delivery. We also compared relative contribution between sexes to nest sanitation. Despite our small sample sizes, our results show that males are more involved in nest sanitation and spend longer at the nest, and both sexes exhibit higher food delivery rates and spend less time at the nest in burned habitat. This latter result may suggest that greater effort is needed to provision Black-backed Wood-pecker nestlings in unburned habitat compared to burned habitat.

Lorenz, Teresa J.; Vierling, Kerri T.; Kozma, Jeffrey M.; Millard, Janet E.; Raphael, Martin G.				Journal of Wildlife Management	79	8		1286-1297	Nov 2015	2015				English	2	51	White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD[plus or minus]59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD[plus or minus]70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre; Leduc, Alain				Forest Ecology and Management	346			10-21	Jun 15 2015	2015				English	2	93	Dead and decaying trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for nesting and foraging. Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.

Condor	117	2		178-191	May 2015	2015				English	0	23	Dramatic fluctuations in food resources are a key feature of many habitats, and many species have evolved a movement strategy to exploit food resources that are unpredictable in space and time. The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small'' prey on each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern.

Holoubek, Nathan S.; Jensen, William E.				Journal of Wildlife Management	79	3		458-468	Apr 2015	2015				English	5	61	Oak savanna, once widespread across central North America, has functionally vanished from most of its range because of land conversion or fire suppression, but much oak savanna remains in the Cross Timbers ecoregion of the south-central United States. We quantified avian habitat associations across a gradient from open oak savanna to woodland, to closed canopy forest in the Cross Timbers of southeastern Kansas. We surveyed breeding bird species in 2012 and 2013 and modeled species-specific occupancy in relation to habitat variables. Several species, including the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), dickcissel (Spiza americana), and orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) were associated with lower levels of tree density or canopy cover (i.e., savanna-woodland). Species associated with greater levels of tree density or canopy cover at some spatial scale included eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea). Occupancy of eastern wood-pewee and blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) were highest at intermediate levels of canopy cover (50-m radius) and tree density, respectively. Occupancies of eastern wood-pewee, northern mockingbird, lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), indigo bunting, and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were variously related to shrub density, which was unrelated to tree cover or density across the savanna-forest gradient. We expect the savanna-associated species would benefit from reduction in tree density to savanna-like habitat (tree canopy cover 25%) within forests that were formerly savanna.

Ecoscience	22	2-4		145-155	2015	2015				English	0	10	Black-backed woodpecker is known to be a disturbance-associated species, being more abundant in disturbed forest stands than in undisturbed habitats, but its demography and population dynamic still need to be clarified. The present study was conducted in central Quebec within coniferous forests shaped largely by timber harvest and wildfire. The objectives were to compare the age composition of breeding black-backed woodpeckers, nest survival rate and productivity in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats (respectively recently burned and unburned habitats). In addition, we evaluated the general productivity of both habitat types in a simulated boreal landscape. There was a positive relationship between nest age and daily survival rates. Older woodpeckers were the most abundant breeders in unburned habitats and younger birds in one-year-old burns. Although nests in recently burned forests produced more nestlings per successful nest, our simulation of a boreal forest landscape showed that unburned habitat produced about two-thirds more fledglings per year than burned habitat. Globally, unburned habitat may provide woodpeckers more temporally stable resources. Population dynamics of the black-backed woodpecker, at least in our study area, may be explained by resource pulse interactions where populations benefit opportunistically from short-term high-quality habitat, and rely on unburned habitats for long-term persistence.

While black-backed woodpeckers are attracted to areas affected by these disturbances, in the Black Hills they exist during interim disturbance periods in largely undisturbed forests. In 2012, a petition for listing black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills as a distinct population segment identified current population size and the population size necessary to minimize risk of extinction as key components of the decision process. Our objective was to estimate the population size of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills National Forest of South Dakota and Wyoming during a period of relatively low disturbance (e.g., 2000-2001). The estimated population was 641 (95% CI = 405-990) and 456 (95% CI = 293-705) breeding pairs in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The average density of 0.12/km2 (95% CI = 0.07-0.18) was similar to densities in other undisturbed forests. This population estimate provides a starting point for population viability analyses during periods of relatively low disturbance by fire or insects.

A large population of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) is present, and we documented the gopher frog (Lithobates capito), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and Florida pine snake (Pituophis melanoleucus). We recorded 68 families of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) totaling 157 individuals and three active clusters of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The easement and adjacent lands had 16 possible previous nest sites of Florida sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), seven Audubon's crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) territories, five southern bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests, and six swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus) nests. We observed signs of Florida black bear (Ursus americanus), and a male Florida panther (Puma concolor) moved onto the property and died of unknown causes. More intensive surveys would be necessary to document additional wildlife species and to determine population levels. We recommend the timely use of prescribed fire as a management tool to maintain or restore dry prairie, scrubby flatwoods, and scrub habitats for wildlife, cattle, and biological diversity.

Florida Field Naturalist	42	2		45-53	May 2014	2014				English	0	4	Nesting ecology of the Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) has rarely been studied, even though the species is widespread and relatively common. I provide here the first study of Great Crested Flycatcher nesting ecology and nest-site selection in tree cavities in the eastern United States. I monitored 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests in a mosaic of slash pine plantations and longleaf pine sandhills in Clay County, Florida. Nest sites were located in slash pine (52%), turkey oak (39%), longleaf pine (7%), and unknown pine species (2%). Most (73%) Great Crested Flycatcher nests were located in abandoned tree cavities excavated by various species, especially the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus). Cavity entrance diameters averaged 6.2 ([plus or minus] 2.5) cm, with most (55%) measured entrances smaller than the minimum previously reported for the species. These findings are contrary to earlier characterizations of the species as showing a strong affinity for large naturally occurring hollows in live trees. Only 19 of 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests (43%) were successful in fledging >=1 young. Mean cavity height was greater for successful nests than for unsuccessful nests, and the primary cause of nest failure was predation. Most flycatcher nests in oaks were located in the understory <3 m above ground where they were particularly vulnerable to predation. More research is needed on the relationships between nest-site selection and nesting success for cavity-nesting species in fire-suppressed habitats with a significant hardwood component.

PLoS ONE	9	4		e94700	Apr 15 2014	2014				English	0	45	Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.

Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size = 460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of >=27 m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees >=27 cm DBH.

Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies	2	1 A		1-5	Feb 2014	2014				English	0	0	The lac insect, Kerria lacca Kerr (Coccoidea: Homoptera) is well known for its valuable resin. It thrives on host plants like Palas, Kusum and Ber. An attempt has been made to study culture of lac in non-conventional method of cultivation in peripheral and buffer zones of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR) where farmers are practicing in a conventional way. The initial density of settlement of larva ranged between 92.58-126.74 no. /cm2 and 93.12-109.62 no. /cm2 in Kusmi strain on Kusum and Ber trees, respectively. For Rangeeni strain it was 82.67-118.32 no. /cm2. The sex ratio (male: female) was found to be 1: 3 for all the crops, strains and host plants. The range of resin output per cell was 17.00-21.40 mg for winter crop and 19.00-25.60 mg for summer crop of Kusmi strain on Kusum and Ber plants. For Rangeeni strain on Palas plant it was 05.30-11.20 mg for rainy crop and 18.72 -23.00 mg for summer crop. Moreover, the temperature influenced the life cycle, life span and resin output of this insect. Pruning of trees meet the firewood requirement as fuel and also for household uses, also prevents deforestation and conserve the forest ecosystem. Lac insect has some vertebrate predators like monkeys, squirrels, rats, lizards, woodpeckers, birds and insect predators are Lepidopterans (Eublemma amabilis, Pseudohypatopa pulverea) and Neuropterans (Chrysopa madestes, C. lacciperda). So directly or indirectly lac cultivation helps in conservation of biodiversity.

Fogg, Alissa M.; Roberts, L. Jay; Burnett, Ryan D.				Avian Conservation and Ecology	9	2		3	2014	2014				English	0	28	Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.

Leite, Gabriel Augusto; Pinheiro, Renato Torres; Marcelino, Dianes Gomes; Cortes Figueira, Jose Eugenio; Charles Delabie, Jacques Hubert				Condor	115	2		221-229	May 2013	2013				English	1	20	Because of the patchiness of their habitat, its perceived low conservation value, and tendency to burn, bamboo-specialist birds are vulnerable to habitat loss. We documented the habitat use and foraging strategies of Celeus obrieni, Kaempfer's Woodpecker, in forested cerrado (savanna) with patches of the bamboo Guadua paniculata near Pium, Tocantins, Brazil. We surveyed for C. obrieni, measured vegetation structure at 30 sites where it was detected and 23 where it was not detected, then compared vegetation characteristics through nonmetric multidimentional scaling and one-way analysis of similarity to determine whether C. obrieni was specializing on particular habitat characteristics. We studied the species' foraging and compared the abundance of prey in drilled and nondrilled stems to evaluate its dietary specialization. All sites with C. obrieni had large, tall stands of G. paniculata, indicating habitat specialization. Drilling most frequently on large, dry stems from 2 to 4 m off the ground, the woodpeckers consumed ants, mainly Camponotus depressus and Azteca fasciata, which colonize the internodes of bamboo stems. Habitat specialists are more vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration but can serve as indicator species for the reaching of conservation goals. Large stands of forested cerrado with patches of bamboo should be conserved for C. obrieni to be maintained. The patchiness of bamboo forest may impede dispersal of C. obrieni.

British Columbia Birds	23			16-26	2013	2013				English	0	2	The Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park bird count is held annually the last weekend of May or the first weekend of June when parties of observers record all birds detected. In 2003 the Okanagan Mountain fire burned 99% of the park at varying intensities, providing a unique opportunity to examine long-term changes in bird species abundance affected by fire. Relative abundance was compared from a period of 11 years before the fire (1993-2003) to a period up to eight years after the fire (five counts from 2006-2011). In total 165 species have been tallied in the 16 counts. The average number of species per count was significantly higher after the burn (104.6) than before (96.3). Of 90 species considered common enough for meaningful statistical analyses, 28 increased in relative abundance after the fire, 11 decreased, and there was no significant difference for 51 species. Increases were particularly noted among: woodpeckers including Hairy, Black-backed, American Three-toed and Northern Flicker; some cavity nesters including House Wren, White-breasted Nuthatch, and Mountain and Western Bluebirds; some insectivores including Olive-sided Flycatcher, Say's Phoebe and Western Wood-Pewee; and shrub-occupying birds including Warbling Vireo, Lazuli Bunting, MacGillivray's Warbler, Song Sparrow and Lincoln's Sparrow. Severe declines were noted for forest inhabiting birds including Red-breasted Nuthatch, Golden-crowned Kinglet and Townsend's Warbler. For most species the response to fire determined by other studies was confirmed.

Seavy, Nathaniel E.; Burnett, Ryan D.; Taille, Paul J.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	36	4		722-728	Dec 2012	2012				English	2	14	Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are well-known to occur at higher densities in recently burned forests than they do in nearby green forests. In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees. Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, the distribution of black-backed woodpeckers in post-fire environments is influenced more by surrounding snag densities than by particular characteristics of potential nest trees.

Smart, L.S.; Swenson, J.J.; Christensen, N.L.; Sexton, J.O.				Forest Ecology and Management	281			100-110	Oct 1 2012	2012				English	1	96	Accurate measurement of forest canopy structure is critical for understanding forest-wildlife habitat relationships. Although most theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11 point/m2) to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7 m for longleaf, 32.3 m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC >.85). The addition of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8% compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models.

On Goias State it has been found on different sites even though the low po- tential to its vegetation occurrence. Thus, we do an environmental diagnosis on C. obrieni incidence sites, identifying soil cover and major land uses, fragments with potential to support its ecological requirements and the main threats to its conservation. Results de- monstrate that the soil cover and use matrix on Porangatu and Novo Planalto quadrants are dominated by agro pasturelands. On Minacu 1 and Minacu 3, the native vegetation area is a little higher than human modified areas, whilec on Minacu 2 different Cerrado physiognomies predominate on the landscape. Average size of potential fragments on Novo Planalto and Porangatu were significantly lower than Minacu fragments, predomi- nating vegetation fragments smaller than 10 ha in all quadrants analyzed. Main threats to C. obrieni are associated to deforestation and fire, generated chiefly by agriculture and pasture expansion over native vegetation.

Chernek, Joseph				Kingbird	62	1		2-20	March 2012	2012				English	0	2	I studied changes in vegetation and breeding birds over 15 years in a Pitch Pine Oak Heath Rocky Summit community at the Mohonk Preserve, Ulster County, NY. Historical data from the Breeding Bird Census (BBC) were grouped into five-year periods of time from 1992 through 2007 and analyzed using geographic information system (GIS) methodology. In 2007, my colleagues and I collected two sets of BBC data, which were compared to the historical data and to each other, to assess variability among observers. Changes in resident species were the inclusion of the Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) in BBC data. Changes in short distance migrants included a decrease in Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) breeding territories, the absence of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) since 1997, and a decrease in Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus). Changes in long distance (neotropical) migrants were increases in the Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) and Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo oliveaceus). Climate data showed increased temperature and increased precipitation over 111 years of data at the Mohonk Lake Cooperative Weather Station. Habitat change has occurred in the study area from 1986 through 2007 associated with Gypsy Moth (Lymantria dispar) attack, drought, the absence of fire, and an ice storm in 2002. Observer variability needs to be taken into account when analyzing bird populations because there is potentially a high level of variance among different observers.

Agricultural and Forest Entomology	13	4		373-381	November 2011	2011				English	0	20	1 Wood-boring larvae in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae are often found in high densities in burned trees after wildland fires. They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source. 2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles. 3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp. 4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables. 5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.

Kronland, William J.; Restani, Marco				Canadian Field-Naturalist	125	4		316-326	Oct 2011	2011				English	0	51	We investigated how post-fire salvage logging of Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) affected populations of cavity-nesting birds and small mammals in southeastern Montana in 2004 and 2005. We examined two salvage and two control plots with three point-count stations and one small mammal trap site randomly distributed across each plot. We used point counts and distance sampling methods to estimate density of cavity-nesting birds on each treatment. We also searched each plot for nests and used program MARK to construct a set of candidate models to investigate variations in nest survival related to treatment, year. and time. We used live traps arranged in webs centered on trapping sites and distance sampling methods to estimate small mammal density. Habitat characteristics were also quantified on each plot. Density of all cavity-nesting birds combined and of Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in particular were higher on the control than the salvage treatment. Density of large trees and abundance of active cavities were higher on the control treatment. Nest cavities on the salvage treatment were most often located in non-logged watersheds. Nest survival estimates were uniformly high, with only marginal variations attributed to treatment and year. Density of Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) was higher on the salvage than the control treatment, reflecting the amount of downed woody debris created during harvest.

Delaney, David K.; Pater, Larry L.; Carlile, Lawrence D.; Spadgenske, Eric W.; Beaty, Timothy A.; Melton, Robert H.				Wildlife Monographs	177			1-38	Jul 2011	2011				English	4	67	Military lands are a valuable resource in recovery of threatened, endangered, and at-risk species worldwide and have the highest density of threatened and endangered species of all major land management agencies in the United States. Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels (dB)) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >=2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

Youngman, Joseph A.; Gayk, Zach G.				Wilson Journal of Ornithology	123	2		381-386	Jun 2011	2011				English	0	14	A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

Saracco, James F.; Siegel, Rodney B.; Wilkerson, Robert L.				ECOSPHERE	2	3		31, 1-17	Mar 2011	2011				English	2	20	The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) has been designated by the USDA Forest Service as a management indicator species for snags in burned conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. However, little is known about the characteristics that affect between-fire and within-fire habitat selection by the species in the region. Here we report on the first broad-scale survey of Black-backed Woodpeckers on wildfire-affected forests of the Sierra Nevada. We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to: 1) estimate Black-backed Woodpecker occupancy probability in fire areas burned within a time window of 1-10 years; 2) identify relationships between occupancy probability and habitat covariates (fire age, change in canopy cover pre-to-post fire, and snag basal area), elevation, and latitude; and 3) estimate detection probability and relate it to survey interval length and survey type (passive v. broadcast). We included random fire-area effects in our model of occupancy probability to accommodate clusters of non-independent points surveyed within the larger set of fire areas. Mean occupancy probability was estimated to be 0.097. Elevation (after controlling for latitude) had the strongest effect on occupancy probability (higher occupancy at higher elevation) followed by latitude (higher occupancy at northerly sites). Fire age was also important; occupancy probability was about 4X higher on the youngest compared to oldest fires. Although the direction of regression coefficients were in the expected direction (positive), snag basal area and canopy cover change were of minor importance in affecting occupancy probability. There was some indication, however, that the importance of snag basal area increased with fire age. Weak links between occupancy and canopy cover change suggested the species uses a range of burn severities, and such heterogeneity may promote habitat longevity. Our estimate of overall detection probability (across all survey intervals) was 0.772. We found strong effects of survey interval length (higher for longer interval) and, especially survey type (higher for broadcast survey) on detection probability. Our modeling framework and implementation illustrates the flexibility of the Bayesian hierarchical approach for handling complexities such as estimating derived parameters (and variances) and modeling random effects, and should prove generally useful for occupancy studies.

We tested if male and female woodpeckers exhibited the same movement patterns using both spatially implicit and explicit genetic analyses to define population structure and movement patterns of both sexes among populations. Three genetic groups were identified, a large, genetically continuous population that spans from the Rocky Mountains to Quebec, a small isolated population in South Dakota and a separate population in the western portion of their distribution (Oregon). Patterns of genetic diversity suggest extensive gene flow mediated by both males and females within the continuous boreal forest. However, male-mediated gene flow is the main form of connectivity between the continuously distributed group and the smaller populations of South Dakota and Oregon that are separated by large areas of unforested habitat, which apparently serves as a barrier to movement of female woodpeckers.

Gaines, William; Haggard, Maryellen; Begley, James; Lehmkuhl, John; Lyons, Andrea				Forest Science	56	1		88-99	Feb 2010	2010				English	0	31	We monitored the short-term (<3 years) response of land birds to restoration treatments (thin, burn, and thin-burn) in dry forests located on the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington. Overall avian community composition did not change among the treatments. However, individual species responses varied with the chipping sparrow showing lower density in treatments, whereas hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, white-headed woodpecker, western bluebird, American crow, and common raven increased in treatment units. Daily survival rates of nesting guilds were similar in treated versus control stands; however, burn-only showed lower daily survival rates compared with other treatments. Additional research is needed to validate this result. Cavity-nesters (mountain chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and house wren) and foliage-nesters (chipping sparrow) used trees that were larger in diameter than available regardless of the treatment. Our results, in combination with other results from this study area, provide important implications for managers: (1) thin-burn treatments were effective at restoring habitat for several avian focal species; (2) spring burn treatments should be carefully designed to achieve desired restoration objectives; (3) large trees provide important habitat functions and are a key component for maintaining or restoring the viability of focal avian species; and (4) additional research is needed to better understand the effects of spring burning and the long-term effects of dry forest restoration treatments.

Farris, Kerry L.; Zack, Steve; Amacher, Andrew J.; Pierson, Jennifer C.				Forest Science	56	1		100-111	Feb 2010	2010				English	1	14	We examined the short-term response of the bark-foraging bird community to mechanical thinning, prescribed fire, and thinning/prescribed fire combination treatments designed to reduce fuel loads at study sites throughout the continental United States as part of the national Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) project. We modeled the effects of study site, treatment, treatment category, and time since treatment on the foraging encounter rate of four individual species (red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), and brown creeper (Certhia americana)) and assessed the relative importance of several tree and snag characteristics in the selection of foraging trees by these same species. The foraging encounter rate of all four species responded inconsistently across both treatment categories and study sites. Substrate diameter was the strongest and most consistent characteristic positively influencing the selection of foraging habitat structures for all species across all treatment categories. Other influential variables included the presence of bark beetles for red-breasted nuthatches, hairy woodpeckers, and brown creepers in control and burn-only treatment areas and tree species for brown creepers in bum-only and thin-only treatment areas. Although this study did not detect any major negative treatment response by any species, our results suggest that there is substantial variability in the reaction of this particular bird community to fuel reduction treatments and that managers may need to evaluate the effects of these treatments on a site-by-site and species-by-species basis.

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.

Bonnot, Thomas W.; Millspaugh, Joshua J.; Rumble, Mark A.				Forest Ecology and Management	259	2		220-228	December 15 2009	2009				English	3	31	Areas of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks in the Black Hills can provide habitat for black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), a U.S. Forest Service, Region 2 Sensitive Species. These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills.

The loss of natural Red-headed Woodpecker habitat (i.e., oak savanna) because of fire suppression and conversion to agriculture is cited as the primary reason for declines and has forced the species to use other habitats. We quantified habitat associations of Red-headed Woodpeckers in southwest Wisconsin and compared habitat variables at points where woodpeckers were detected with random point. Our results suggest distance to number of snags, and amount of tree in pastures were positively related to Red-headed Woodpecker occurrence. Pastures with tree cover tend to most resemble savanna habitat and provide foraging opportunities for Red-headed Woodpeckers and snags provide potential nesting sites. We conclude that Red-headed woodpeckers in agricultural areas would benefit from two habitat management practices that would not affect agricultural production: (1) retaining dead trees and (2) maintaining tree cover in pastures.

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre				Biological Conservation	142	7		1381-1391	July 2009	2009				English	3	43	The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.

Ecological Applications	19	5		1253-1263	July 2009	2009				English	4	117	Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.

Pope, Theresa L.; Block, William M.; Beier, Paul				Journal of Wildlife Management	73	5		695-700	July 2009	2009				English	0	12	We examined effects of prescribed fire on 3 wintering, bark-foraging birds, hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea), and white-breasted nuthatches (S. carolinensis), in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. During winters of 2004[long dash]2006, we compared bird density, foraging behavior, and bark beetle activity among burned treatment and unburned control units. Hairy woodpecker density was 5 times greater in burn units, whereas white-breasted nuthatches and pygmy nuthatches had similar densities between treatments. Compared to available trees, trees used by foraging hairy woodpeckers had 9 times greater odds of having bark beetles in control units and 12 times greater odds in burn units. Tree diameter appeared to be the main factor bark-foraging birds used in selecting winter foraging trees. Our results suggest that forest managers can use prescribed fire treatments without detrimental effects to wintering nuthatches, while providing additional food to hairy woodpeckers.

Ecological Applications	19	3		608-621	April 2009	2009				English	1	20	Landscape-scale disturbance events, including ecological restoration and fuel reduction activities, can modify habitat and affect relationships between species and their environment. To reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing. res in the southwestern United States, land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments ( e. g., mechanical thinning, prescribed. re) in progressively larger stands of dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large ([approximately]250-400 ha) prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea), Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), and Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus)) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.

Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.				Forestry Chronicle	85	2		218-226	March-April 2009	2009				English	0	15	Policy direction to emulate natural disturbance in managed boreal forests has spurred a need to contrast the dynamics of biota on landscapes originating from timber harvest and from wildfire (hereafter, "managed" and "natural"). Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.

Our objectives were to examine factors that allowed for co-existence in two burned pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We monitored 53 Lewis's and 38 Red-headed Woodpecker nests between 2002 and 2005, and compared clutch initiation dates and nest-site selection. Clutch initiation dates did not differ between species for 3 of 4 years. We compared multiple habitat factors surrounding nests of the two species, and only tree and snag densities differed between Red-headed Woodpecker nest sites (65.1[plus or minus] 5.78 stems/ha) and those of Lewis's Woodpeckers (48.5[plus or minus] 6.06 stems/ha). These results are consistent with the foraging techniques used by the two species. We suggest that habitat partitioning is an important mechanism of coexistence for these two species, but also recommend further research on their foraging strategies.

Cahall, Rebecca E.; Hayes, John P.				Forest Ecology and Management	257	3		1119-1128	February 10 2009	2009				English	0	23	In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5[long dash]6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations.

Due to its narrow foraging niche, forest management practices and dead-wood collection for fire-wood impact on its survival removing available resources for WBW's and its preys. Within a Life project (LifeO4/NAT/IT/000190) we started WBW monitoring to assess its presence in Natura 2000 sites and characteristics of forests associated to it. In 2008 we sampled (playback call) WBW presence sites (N = 13, 2000-2007 data) + 82 grid points within a 1 square-km buffer around presence sites across a systematic grid (total: 75 sampling sites). We carried out 283 playback sessions (mean: 3.2 sessions/point). WBW occurred 19 times within 15 plots. WBW were present in 20% of points. Even-aged, uneven-aged and irregular high-growth stands were used more than available (c2 = 21.5; p< 0.01) as well as mature and adult high-growth stands (c2= 32.8: p = 0.0001). N. of snags and trees dbh > 50 cm was not significantly different between WBW detected vs. not detected sites. Our results suggest collection of further stand quantitative parameters to properly address both research and forest management guidelines for WBW conservation.

Ecological Applications	18	8		1827-1834	December 2008	2008				English	10	77	Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural'' or "unhealthy.'' Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be much broader than commonly appreciated.

Hanson, Chad T.; North, Malcolm P.				Condor	110	4		777-782	November 2008	2008				English	2	29	In forests, high-severity burn patches[long dash]wherein most or all of the trees are killed by fire[long dash]often occur within a mosaic of low- and moderate-severity effects. Although there have been several studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have been few studies of effects on bird species associated with high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides arcticus), Hairy (P. villosus), and White-headed (P. albolarvatus) Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged; high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no significant difference in presence among conditions. These results suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers.

Burke, Jason D.; Chamberlain, Michael J.; Geaghan, James P.				Journal of Wildlife Management	72	6		1361-1368	August 2008	2008				English	0	9	Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have experienced severe declines for several decades, and declines have been particularly precipitous in the southern United States. These declines are partially attributable to large-scale conversions of potential habitat to short-rotation pine (Pinus spp.) forests managed for wood fiber production and fire exclusion in pine-dominated landscapes. We used standard arthropod sampling techniques, human-imprinted bobwhite chicks, and vegetation response to evaluate effects of different understory vegetation management practices on brood habitat quality within a commercially managed pine forest in Louisiana, USA, during 2002-2005. Specifically, we evaluated effects of mowing, prescribed fire during the growing season, prescribed fire in combination with imazapyr application, and no vegetation management on arthropod abundance and diversity, vegetation response, and the probability of bobwhite chicks successfully capturing an arthropod. Bobwhite chicks were more successful at capturing arthropods, and arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest, in plant communities managed using prescribed fire and imazapyr. Forest stands managed using a combination of fire and imazapyr were managed primarily to benefit the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis; RCW). Our findings suggest that management directed toward improving forest condition for RCWs improves habitat quality for. brooding bobwhites. However, bobwhite chicks in our study area were less successful at capturing arthropods than were chicks in other studies in the southeastern United States. Brood-earing habitat in pine forests similar to those we studied may be of generally poor quality, and could be related to precipitous declines of bobwhites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Managers should recognize that creating high-quality brood habitat in forests similar to those we studied will require more intensive management of understory vegetation than we studied.

George, T. Luke; Zack, Steve				Canadian Journal of Forest Research	38	5		936-942	May 2008	2008				English	0	15	We compared the effects of two contrasting silvicultural treatments and prescribed fire on bird occupancy at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest. Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100 ha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

The massive expansion of this natural disturbance agent is a result of both natural and human-associated influences Including milder winter weather and fire Suppression policy. Resource managers are grappling with a response to the infestation that considers economic, social, and ecological factors. In British Columbia the response has moved from a control or sanitation phase, to an economic recovery or salvage phase. The condition of the landscape resulting from the insect and the management associated with each phase will impact wildlife populations. Distribution and abundance of certain species will either increase or decline in response to changes in the forest vegetation and hydrologic regime. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), fisher (Martes pennanti), marten (Martes americana), woodpeckers, and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) are considered species with high sensitivity to mortality of pine trees that will adversely affect their forage, cover, and nesting/denning habitat.

Nielsen-Pincus, Nicole; Garton, Edward O.				Northwestern Naturalist	88	3		135-146	Winter 2007	2007				English	0	0	Despite an abundance of studies describing nest selection in cavity-nesting birds, few account for the variation in habitat availability across the geographic range of a species and through time. Changes in the frequency of disturbances such as fires, timber harvests, and insect outbreaks can dramatically alter habitat. Responses by cavity-nesting birds to these changes provide an opportunity to evaluate underlying determinants of nest selection. We compared nest site attributes to available resources for 3 species of cavity-nesting birds: the Pileated Wood-pecker (Dryocopus pileatus), Williamson's Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus thyroideus), and Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus). Data collected in 2003-2004 were compared to data collected in the 1970s in the same study area to identify changes in patterns of selection. Due to severe insect outbreaks, available resources differed greatly between the 2 time periods. In studies separated by 30 y, Pileated Woodpeckers and Black-backed Woodpeckers exhibited remarkable consistency in patterns of nest site selection. Both species still selected Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags preferentially for nesting despite their decline in availability. Williamson's Sapsuckers were less selective and nested in the most abundant snag species during both time periods. Selection for factors such as tree size and degree of decay remained consistent regardless of differences in habitat availability for the 3 species. By identifying these general patterns of nest site selection, our conclusions are applicable to a wider variety of habitat conditions.

Grundel, Ralph; Pavlovic, Noel B.				Auk	124	3		969-985	July 2007	2007				English	3	27	Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

Saab, Victoria A.; Russell, Robin E.; Dudley, Jonathan G.				Condor	109	1		97-108	February 2007	2007				English	2	56	We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel (Falco sparperius), Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and Mountain Bluebird (S. currucoides)) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), Black-backed Woodpecker (P. arcticus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus)), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

Gentry, Dale J.; Vierling, Kerri T.				Condor	109	1		122-131	February 2007	2007				English	0	12	Crown-burned pine forests are an important breeding habitat for many cavity-nesting birds, and can serve as a source habitat for some woodpecker species. However, it is unclear if this function continues with postburn succession as predators recolonize burned habitats and snag density declines. Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) are considered "burn specialists" and are a species of conservation concern. We monitored Lewis's Woodpeckers nesting in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests to determine the source or sink function of old-burn habitats in the Black Hills of South Dakota (study units burned in 1988 and 1991); concurrently, we examined avian and mammalian predator communities within burned and unburned areas. Between 2002 and 2005 we found 55 Lewis's Woodpecker nests, 51 of which were successful. Using adult and juvenile mortality rates for other melanerpine species taken from the literature, we determined that the old-burn habitats we sampled were acting as sources for Lewis's Woodpeckers. Point Counts and tracking tube surveys suggested that both avian and mammalian predators had successfully recolonized these old-burn habitats, as both groups were common in old burns and in unburned forests. The unusually high nesting success of Lewis's Woodpeckers in the Black Hills is likely due to the absence of some common nest predators. While the high success rates might continue, we suggest that the overall contribution of young to the region from these burned sites will decline as suitable habitat components (such as snags) decline with the continuation of postfire succession.

This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus; martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca).

Condor	108	4		817-831	November 2006	2006				English	3	51	We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

We measured reproductive parameters and nest-site characteristics at 17 Red-headed Woodpecker nests and 17 random sites between 2001 and 2004 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. The average date the first egg was laid was 17 June, and the average clutch size was 5.4 [plus or minus] 0.4. The daily nest survival rate averaged 0.98 (overall nest success = 47%), and predation was the major cause of nest failure. Red-headed Woodpecker nests occurred farther from grassland edges in large diameter snags within severely burned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands. High-severity fire within these aspen stands resulted in a combination of snag and understory characteristics that differed from the surrounding pine forest matrix. Interactions between cover type and burn severity may have important ecological consequences for Red-headed Woodpeckers in a mixed conifer forest.

Allen, Jennifer C.; Krieger, Sharlene M.; Walters, Jeffrey R.; Collazo, Jaime A.				Auk	123	4		1110-1128	October 2006	2006				English	4	54	We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >=150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis)) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla)) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythropthalamus), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas)) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

Bateman, Heather L.; O'Connell, Margaret A.				Northwest Science	80	4		283-291	Autumn 2006	2006				English	1	6	Primary cavity-nesting birds play a critical role in forest ecosystems by excavating cavities later used by other birds and mammals as nesting or roosting sites. Several species of cavity-nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to winter conditions. We conducted winter bird counts from 1998 to 2000 to examine the abundance and habitat association of cavity-nesting birds in prescribed burned and unburned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands. Bark foragers such as woodpeckers (Picoides spp.) and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) were associated with fewer small trees and recently decayed snags and logs. Foliage gleaners such as the chickadees (Poecile spp.) were associated with small diameter snags. The juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands is important for individual birds reliant upon other members of a mixed-species flock and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important for maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage.

Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

We wanted to determine how these habitats are colonized by this species and by which age classes. Data collected at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (situated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)) suggest that an important movement of juveniles occurs during the autumn. It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire, burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between the two habitat types ([chi]2 = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186). However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn.

However, with presence-absence datasets there is a problem associated with the comparison between habitats when there is an inter-habitat variation in the proportion of false zeros. Using conspecific playbacks and time of reaction of black-backed woodpeckers in burned and unburned forests, the present study determined whether detection probabilities were similar. The period of time required to detect this species was shorter in recently burned sites than in mature forest stands (F2.235 = 22.1, df = 2, P 0.0001). To accurately compare these habitats it is important to assure the same proportion of presence and false zeros in each habitat during the census. To achieve this, we propose a time corrected method. Because inter-habitat differences in detectability exist for black-backed woodpeckers, and probably many other organisms, caution is needed when interpreting presence-absence data in the context of habitat comparisons or when monitoring biodiversity in different habitats.

Conservation Biology	20	2		460-469	April 2006	2006				English	2	68	Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.

Hanula, James L.; Horn, Scott; Wade, Dale D.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report SRS	93			57-66	2006	2006				English	0	7	Dead wood is a major component of forests and contributes to overall diversity, primarily by supporting insects that feed directly on or in it. Further, a variety of organisms benefit by feeding on those insects. What is not well known is how or whether dead wood influences the composition of the arthropod community that is not solely dependent on it as a food resource, or whether woody debris influences prey available to generalist predators. One group likely to be affected by dead wood is ground-dwelling arthropods. We studied the effect of adding large dead wood to unburned and frequently burned pine stands to determine if dead wood was used more when the litter and understory plant community are removed. We also studied the effect of annual removal of dead wood from large (10-ha) plots over a 5-year period on ground-dwelling arthropods. In related studies, we examined the relationships among an endangered woodpecker that forages for prey on live trees, its prey, and dead wood in the forest. The results of these and other studies show that dead wood can influence the abundance and diversity of the ground-dwelling arthropod community and of prey available to generalist predators not foraging directly on dead trees.

Kuznetsova, Darja V.; Salovarov, Viktor O.; Lieser, Manfred				Vogelwelt	127	2		85-90	2006	2006				German	0	1	Spring fires produce fundamental changes of the forest bird communities in the Baikal area, due to destruction of nests and habitat modifications. Out of 24 species inhabiting old pine forests, only three (Tree Pipit, Coal Tit, Scarlet Rosefinch) were still found immediately after the fire; 1 one species (Song Thrush) newly occurred. Bird abundance declined to approx. 20%. Only the Tree Pipit maintained its previous density and continued to predominate. In late summer, nine species were seen, and Great Spotted Woodpecker, Coal Tit, and Willow Tit reached the density they had prior to the fire. Total bird abundance was minimal during that phase (63 ind./km2). Three years after the fire, 12 species were found in early summer, the growth of shrubbery favouring warblers, Siberian Rubythroat, Red-flanked Bluetail, Brown Shrike (all new), and Scarlet Rosefinch. Having dominated the previous communities, the Tree Pipit exhibited a significant decline. The increasing food supply during summer (berries etc.) supported new species (Hazel Grouse, thrushes), which then occurred at high densities. However, the number of species and the total bird abundance were still below the values of the initial communities in old forests.

Todd; Vickery, Peter D.; Perkins, Dustin W.; Shriver, W. Gregory				Studies in Avian Biology	30			147-160	27 July 2005	2005				English	0	3	Fire, both natural and anthropogenic, has played a critical role in shaping vegetation structure and composition of many of the plant communities of the southeastern United States. Pine savannas, especially longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), that were dominant over much of the upland coastal plain, have declined by approximately 97% over the past 100 yr. The inferred natural fire regime of this vegetation type was a fire frequency of 2-8 yr with typically low-severity fires that occurred during the lightning season (June-August). Currently, dormant-season (January through April) fires are used most frequently. Approximately 110-120 species, excluding migrants, comprise the avian community of southeastern pine savannas; and some of these are among the most rapidly declining bird species in the eastern United States. Disruption of the natural fire regime by fire exclusion or lengthened fire interval was detrimental to bird species associated with tree (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) and ground cover components (e.g., Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) of the ecosystem. Lightning-season fire has mixed effects on birds (e.g., loss of some nests, but improved brood habitat); therefore, creation of patches of different burn treatments should be carefully considered. The foremost management and conservation challenge is to increase the number of acres of southeastern pine savannas burned frequently through thoughtful application of prescribed burning. Important research challenges include measuring tradeoffs among bird species and other wildlife for different fire regimes, evaluating metapopulation effects of different landscape applications of fire, and considering the nutrient dynamics of different fire regimes on bird populations.

Ortega, Catherine; Ortega, Joseph; Walton, Joshua				Colorado Birds	39	2		56-63	April 2005	2005				English	0	1	The Missionary Ridge Fire of 2002 burned 70,662 acres in southwest Colorado. In the summer of 2003, we conducted bird censuses, monitored nests, and investigated nest site selection by Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) around Vallecito and Lemon reservoirs, La Plata County, Colorado. We conducted censuses from 9 May through 25 July on three transects with 26 plots on unburned sites and five transects with 47 plots on burned sites. The mean number of Hairy Woodpeckers was significantly higher on burned sites (0.26 +/-0.35 individuals/plot) than unburned sites (0.07 +1-0.12 individuals/plot). All Hairy Woodpecker nests were found within the burned sites. We sampled vegetation within 12.5 m of all Hairy Woodpecker nests and at random plots. Compared to randomly available habitat, Hairy Woodpeckers selected nest sites with taller nest trees, shorter distance to nearest dead tree, higher percent of live ground matter, more dead deciduous trees (mostly dead Quaking Aspen, Populus tremuloides), and more emerging aspen saplings. The results have important implications in post-fire management of this U.S. Forest Service Management Indicator Species.	Walton, Joshua; P.O. Box 546, Mancos, CO 81328, USA, USA.

Vogelgemeinschaften als Indikatoren fuer Waldstrukturen in Eichenwaeldern.	Mueller, Joerg				Ornithologische Beobachter	102	1		15-32	Maerz 2005	2005				German	0	0	Bird communities were tested as indicators of different woodland structures in oak woods of Franconian (Bavaria, southern Germany) coppice-with-standards, conversion and high forests, as well as in Strict Forest Reserves. On the basis of grid map-ping and using the canonical correspondence analysis, which combines complex data on all bird species and data on the environment, it was possible to show that breeding bird communities are better suited to indicate differences in the structure of deciduous woods than wintering bird communities. Characteristic species of open stands during the breeding season (Fig. 7) are Tree Pipit Anthers trivialis, Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur, Wryneck Jinx torquilla and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis. Species of two layer stands are Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus, Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canes, Fieldfare Turdus pilaris, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Willow Warbler P. trochilus. Characteristic species of staggered oakwoods mixed with coniferous trees are Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Firecrest R. ignicapillus, Coal Tit Pares ater and Common Crossbill Loria curvirostra, usually typical for conifer woods, and Wren Troglodytes troglodytes. Characteristic for dense woods are, in order of decreasing indicator function, Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Middle Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius. Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, European Nuthatch Sitto europaeu, Eurasian Treecreeper Certhia familaris, Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor, Great Spotted Woodpecker D. major and Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes. Further proof for the indicator function of different bird species could be achieved by a species-indicatoranalysis (Table 3). Beside the Middle Spotted Woodpecker, the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis is the second important target species of conservation management in oak woods. Multivariate analysis resulted in only a minor function of this species, but there was a strong correlation for this species to occur in woods with a high proportion of dead branches in crowns of live oaks (Fig. 8).

English	2	20	Deforestation, forest degradation and hunting are having an increasing impact on wildlife in Borneo and many species are threatened. The Indonesian government has pledged to do its best to control these problems, a pledge that has been formalized in a range of laws and international agreements. But despite the need for immediate and definitive actions, achieving conservation goals remains fraught with challenges. Part of the problem is that conservation interest has focused on protected and unlogged forest, but we need to recognise that logged forest is a vital component of any comprehensive approach to landscape-scale conservation. Our review focuses on the ecological and life history aspects of Bornean vertebrates and how these relate to forest management, with a specific emphasis on lowland and hill dipterocarp forest. But ecological studies seldom lead to improved forest management practices. Our review provides three responses to this: 1. Recommendations in the research literature are compiled and translated into management implications. These can be presented to those who need to know about them. 2. Knowing that a species declines with forestry interventions is seldom enough to clarify how forestry practices might be adapted (short of a ban) in order to mitigate the negative impacts. We set out to link species sensitivity with ecological and life history correlates to develop a better understanding of why a given taxon is vulnerable, allowing a more species-specific approach to the protection of habitat characteristics and components. 3. Research needs to answer management relevant questions. We identify priority topics for research. Our primary intention is thus to identify and clarify what makes fauna vulnerable to various kinds of forestry-related interventions. Based on these results, insights and related hypotheses, we compile and develop recommendations for improved management practices and identify priorities for future research. We are pragmatic: we acknowledge the critical role of the socio-political context for implementing our proposals. Yet, while various key issues are raised, the pace of change in Indonesia is currently so rapid and the issues so complex that our discussion of this context cannot resolve all the current and future opportunities. We focus, therefore, on technical ecological information, the validity of which is independent of volatile local politics. We found a considerable body of ecological information relevant to the management of tropical forests and their wildlife. Improving current management practices requires collaborations between ecologists and forest managers to develop pragmatic guidance for improved practices. The present review and synthesis is one component in achieving this collaboration, focusing upon the fauna of the Malinau area in East Kalimantan (Indonesia).In Part I of this book we summarize knowledge concerning various forest interventions and how they affect selected wildlife species. We identify a range of effects caused by timber harvesting, and note the associated influences of hunting and forest fragmentation. Additional problems are caused by exotic species, law enforcement, fires and a range of other factors. Yet despite decades of wildlife research on Borneo there is little information on the magnitude and mechanisms of threats to wildlife. Most studies considered in this book report on autecological studies of various species, but do not analyse species characteristics in relation to different threat levels. Still, we are able to draw various conclusions about the effects of timber harvesting and associated factors on wildlife, and provide general management recommendations. Selective logging has fewer direct negative consequences for many vertebrate species than is sometimes assumed. It certainly affects certain groups of species, like terrestrial, insectivorous birds and mammals, which suffer from the reduced ground cover. This may primarily be caused by the slashing of ground cover and lianas, which is currently required by law. Some species, though, such as deer and banteng, appear well adapted to, and can increase in, the more open habitats that follow logging. Timber harvesting generally brings a number of associated problems in addition to the direct disturbance of forest habitat. Two important aspects, from a wildlife conservation perspective, are increased hunting and forest fragmentation. Hunting can pose a considerable threat to some forest fauna and this threat often increases with forestry roads, increased access to forests and the provisioning needs of camps. Improved hunting technologies and increasing availability of guns add to the pressure. Roads, skid trails and degraded areas fragment forest habitats. Small isolated populations, such as those created by fragmented or heavily harvested landscapes, are at much greater risk of various deleterious effects that can ultimately lead to local extinction. Some species have minimum fragment size requirements for population persistence. Recent research has highlighted the importance of maintaining 'forest-like' habitats, or a network of 'forest stepping-stone' habitats in the intervening landscape. The effects seem likely to be worst in forests with excessive road density, wide clearings, and many large deforested openings. Forest edges can generate signifi cant effects on individual, population, and community dynamics in remaining forest areas. Several studies report that the effects of logging can extend considerable distances into surrounding undisturbed forests. In Part II of this book we analyse species in relation to their tolerance to the effects of logging and forest change. Using multivariate analyses we identify various factors associated with bird and mammal species that are vulnerable to logging interventions. These factors are dietary specialization, restricted feeding strata, endemicity, apparent evolutionary age (those that evolved during the Miocene or Early Pliocene) and absence from small islands. Factors which we found not to be significant in our data set are group size, number of young per litter, body weight and home range size. Terrestrial insectivores and frugivores appear particularly sensitive to timber harvest practices, whereas herbivores and omnivores were more tolerant or even benefited from logging. Based on these fi ndings we provide recommendations on forest management for concession managers, local and national governments, in Part III. We support the application of good conservation planning, good road building and reduced impact logging methods. Specific recommendations include the retention of ecologically important habitat structures (large trees, hollow trees, fruiting species) and locations (salt licks, watercourses). In terms of silvicultural practices we recommend that understorey slashing (currently a legal requirement) be discontinued. We recommend regulating hunting in timber concessions; law enforcement authorities and concession managers must be able to control this. Hunting of vulnerable species would ideally be eliminated. It is important to retain a contiguous forest. Where forest areas are broken up by wide-roads, logging and agriculture, forest corridors should be maintained as much as possible to maximize connectivity within the forest matrix. At the concession level, retaining linear forest elements (e.g., riverine forests) as corridors between forest blocks can increase faunal dispersal and thus the chances of species survival in forest patches. Reducing the width of roads and tracks, maintaining canopy connectivity over roads, and limiting felling-gap sizes, should also reduce the effects of fragmentation on arboreal species. In addition to these more general recommendations, we suggest many specific actions that might help the conservation of several specific species. Examples include the need to set aside sufficiently large areas for protected large carnivores (Malayan Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard), retain large dipterocarp trees for Helmeted Hornbill nesting and for Great Slaty Woodpecker feeding, and regulate collection of freshwater turtles. We highlight, amongst other things, how governments can better support wildlife conservation in forestry concessions. The government has the important task of evaluating the list of species presently protected in Indonesia, as many rare and endangered species are missing from the list (e.g., Straw-headed Bulbul). We call for an operational action plan to ensure that clear conservation goals are effectively implemented at the concession level (current requirements, though well-intended, have little impact on management choices). We find several areas where effective biodiversity-friendly forestry management is limited by our lack of knowledge. In Part IV we focus on this and provide research recommendations. While research will continue to contribute to our understanding of how timber harvesting practices and their associated impacts might be refi ned to benefit wildlife conservation, a lack of knowledge cannot be used to justify delay in implementing our main recommendations. We may not yet be in a position to describe and advocate perfect management, but we can definitely propose substantial improvements of current practices.

Census activities were carried out between october 1997 and october 1998. Overall, we recorded 47 species, 20 of which were breeding, during 68 monitoring sessions (63 days). The highest species number was observed in spring (april, 34 species) and autumn, during the migration periods. The site hosted several migratory species, among which some long-distance migrants. The abundance of breeding birds was estimated by means of territory mapping: overall, we recorded 78 pairs, corresponding to a total of breeding density of 14.3 pairs/ha. The most abundant species were Blackbird (3.31) pairs/ha) and Chaffinch (1.84 pairs/ha). It is worth noting the presence of single nesting pairs of Firecrest, Wryneck, Great Spotted Woodpecker and Nuthatch. Overall, the recorded avian community appears to reflect the high environmental quality of the site.

Engstrom, R. Todd; Palmer, William E.				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	191			1151-1157	2005	2005				English	0	0	Sport hunting for Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) is the reason that approximately 300,000 acres of semi-wild lands still exist in the Red Hills region of north Florida and south Georgia. Use of fire for management and relatively large (400 to 4,000 ha), contiguous land ownerships permitted populations of bobwhite and Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) to persist in the Red Hills as regional populations of these two species declined precipitously. Three factors play important roles in the habitat shared by these species: canopy cover, canopy tree species composition, and ground cover composition. These factors affect quality of fuel, which influences the occurrence of fire (ecological stability) and the costs of land management (economic stability). We used simple habitat models for these species to examine tradeoffs that optimize habitat conditions for each species. Maintaining conditions that enable healthy populations of both species to co-exist into the 21st century will require innovative management tools, including habitat restoration, and serious interest in conservation within the community of landowners.

Gault, Kathleen E.; Walters, Jeffrey R.; Tomcho, Joseph Jr; Phillips, Louis F.; Butler, Andrew				Southeastern Naturalist	3	2		191-204	June 30 2004	2004				English	1	11	The Southeastern American Kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus), a non-migratory subspecies of the widespread American Kestrel, has declined to the point that it is listed as threatened in Florida, the state in which it is most common. We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.

Condor	106	1		37-49	February 2004	2004				English	3	38	The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

Hiers, J. Kevin; Laine, Stephen C.; Bachant, J.J.; Furman, James H.; Greene, Weldon W., Jr; Compton, Vernon				Conservation Biology	17	6		1571-1578	December 2003	2003				English	1	16	Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to manage public lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire across the landscape within any given year Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U.S.A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.

Hayes, John P.; Weikel, Jennifer M.; Huso, Manuela M.P.				Ecological Applications	13	5		1222-1232	October 2003	2003				English	3	34	Silvicultural practices, such as thinning, are increasingly performed both for commodity production and to help achieve biodiversity goals and promote ecological restoration. However, relatively little research has examined effects of thinning conifer forests on vertebrates. We experimentally manipulated stands using a randomized block design to evaluate influences of two thinning intensities on populations of diurnal breeding birds in western Oregon. We conducted point counts of birds seven times each year in 1994 (prior to treatment) and from. 1995 through 2000 (subsequent to treatment). We analyzed data using multiple linear regression and information-theoretic approaches to model selection. Of the 22 species for which we had sufficient data for analysis, detections of nine species decreased and eight species increased in thinned stands relative to controls, and there was no strong evidence that thinning influenced numbers of five species. Of the 17 species that responded to thinning, the magnitude of response of eight species varied with thinning intensity; for each of these species, response was greatest in the more heavily thinned stands. Although no species was extirpated from stands following thinning, detections of Hutton's Vireos (Vireo huttoni), Golden-crowned Kinglets (Regulus satrapa), Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Blackthroated Gray Warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Varied Thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) decreased to less than half of the detections in controls in one or more treatment types, suggesting thinning significantly reduces their numbers. In contrast, American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Townsend's Solitaires (Myadestes towizsendi), and Hammond's Flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii) were rare or absent in controls but regularly present in thinned stands, and detections of Western Tanagers (Piranga ludoviciana), Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothrazistes vespertinus), and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) increased by threefold or more in thinned stands relative to controls. Only Pacific-slope Flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Western Tanagers showed strong evidence of temporal trends in response. For these species, differences between numbers in controls and treated stands became more extreme through time. Our findings suggest that thinning densely stocked conifer stands in landscapes dominated by younger stands enhances habitat suitability for several species of birds, but that some unthinned patches and stands should be retained to provide refugia for species that are impacted by thinning.

Guerrieri, Gaspare; Castaldi, Amalia				Rivista Italiana di Ornitologia	73	1		55-70	30 Settembre 2003	2003				Italian	0	0	We have studied for three years (2001-2003) the effects of a bush fire and the following interventions on the environment regarding populations of Green Woodpecker, Picus viridis, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Picoides major, and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, Picoides minor, in a Mediterranean coastal pine-forest (Castel Fusano, Rome). The area has been studied also during the two years before the bush fire (1999-2000), that burnt about 30%) of the whole forest (900 ha). Previous to the fire, P. viridis average density, calculated in the mature areas of the pine-forest, was 0.40 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.55), P. major's was 1.27 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.85) and P. minor's was 0.24 territories per 10 ha (S.D. = 0.43). After the bush fire (2001-2002), the territories contraction of P. viridis and P. major was 14% and 28%, respectively. The average density in the spared areas, or only damaged by the fire, was significantly increased (1.00-0.86 and 2.00-1.86 territories per 10 ha). For P. minor, instead, the average density in the mature, not burnt areas of the pine-forest, was not significantly increased (0.29-0.25 territory per 10 ha), while the 36% and the 40% of the territory was burnt. During the 2003 breeding season, after the interventions for the environment reclamation, also on the spared areas, the density of the three species was further reduced of 35%, 53%, 60%, respectively. At that time, density was reduced especially in the pine-forest areas recently planted, not burnt by the fire, but subjected to thinning out of pines and underwood elimination (-50%, -72%, -100%).

Nappi, Antoine; Drapeau, Pierre; Giroux, Jean-Francois; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.				Auk	120	2		505-511	April 2003	2003				English	0	15	We studied snag use for foraging by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) one year after a fire in an eastern black spruce (Picea mariana) boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America.

Hill, Rebecca L.; White, Clayton M.				Nationalpark Berchtesgaden Forschungsbericht	48			81-86	2003	2003				English	0	0	The Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus is an uncommon bird of the boreal forest that is dependent on recent burns and Spruce Bark Beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis infestation for foraging (Fig. 1). Populations of Three-toed Woodpeckers in south-central Utah have increased recently due to the large scale spread of spruce bark beetle infestation. Subsequently, much of this area has been targeted for salvage logging. We studied habitat use and behavior of Three-toed Woodpeckers in logged and unlogged portions of beetle-infested Engelmann spruce Picea engelmannii forest on Monroe Mountain, Utah, Fishlake National Forest, from May to August 2000. Micro and macro-habitat data and bird behavior were recorded at 60 sites where Three-toed Woodpeckers were observed. Comparisons of habitat parameters were made between feed, nest, and drum trees. Engelmann spruce was used most heavily for feeding and comprised 97 % of feed trees. Forty-four percent of nest trees were in Aspen Populus tremutoides, with the remaining 56 % in broken top conifers. Average forest canopy cover differed between the three types of trees (p < 0.05), with feed trees having the highest canopy cover (69.7 [plus or minus] 16 %) (mean [plus or minus] SD), and nest trees the lowest (19.9 [plus or minus] 18 %). Canopy cover was also less in logged than in unlogged areas (p< < 0.001). Outer debarking was significantly greater (p > 0.05) on feed (55 [plus or minus] 27 %) and drum trees (31 [plus or minus] 34 %) than on nest trees (6 [plus or minus] 10%). Nest trees were found to occur in less aggregated stands of surrounding random trees than were feed and drum trees (p < 0.05). Distance to habitat edge was less in logged areas than in unlogged areas (p< 0.10). These findings suggest that according to certain habitat parameters, Three-toed Woodpeckers use different types of trees for feeding, nesting, and drumming, and in logged and unlogged areas. This indicates that perpetuation of mature aspen and old-growth Engelmann spruce is important in maintaining Three-toed Woodpecker populations.

Fayt, Philippe				Ornis Fennica	80	4		182-192	2003	2003				English	4	20	The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a burnt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumn-spring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level of the bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.

D'Eon, Robert G.; Glenn, Susan M.; Parfitt, Ian; Fortin, Marie-Josee				Conservation Ecology	6	2		Unpaginated	December 2002	2002	http://www.consecol.org/Journal/			English	0	2	Landscape connectivity is considered a vital element of landscape structure because of its importance to population survival. The difficulty surrounding the notion of landscape connectivity is that it must be assessed at the scale of the interaction between an organism and the landscape. We present a unique method for measuring connectivity between patches as a function of organism vagility. We used this approach to assess connectivity between harvest, old-growth, and recent wildfire patches in a real forested landscape in southeast British Columbia. By varying a distance criterion, habitat patches were considered connected and formed habitat clusters if they fell within this critical distance. The amount of area and distance to edge within clusters at each critical distance formed the basis of connectivity between patches. We then assessed landscape connectivity relative to old-growth associates within our study area based on species' dispersal abilities. Connectivity was greatest between harvest patches, followed by old-growth, and then wildfire patches. In old-growth patches, we found significant trends between increased connectivity and increased total habitat amount, and between decreased connectivity and increased old-growth harvesting. Highly vagile old-growth associates, such as carnivorous birds, perceive this landscape as connected and are able to access all patches. Smaller, less vagile species, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, may be affected by a lack of landscape connectivity at the scale of their interaction with old-growth patches. Of particular concern is the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), which we predict is limited in this landscape due to relatively weak dispersal abilities.

Journal of Wildlife Management	66	4		1031-1039	October 2002	2002				English	1	11	We compared northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance and habitat characteristics in unmanaged mixed shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-hardwood stands and restored pine-grassland stands managed for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, USA. To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

Saenz, Daniel; Conner, Richard N.; McCormick, James R.				Wilson Bulletin	114	3		291-296	September 2002	2002				English	1	4	Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) cause damage to Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) cavity trees in the form of cavity enlargement or other excavations on the surface of the pine tree. However, it is not known whether Pileated Woodpeckers excavate more frequently on Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity trees than on noncavity trees or how stand structure is related to the frequency of Pileated Woodpecker excavation. Also, it is unclear whether the cavity itself provides the stimulus to Pileated Woodpeckers to excavate or whether the presence of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and their activities are attracting them. We surveyed all of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity trees (n = 202) and 110 control trees in the loblolly (Pinus taeda)-shortleaf (P. echinata) pine habitat on the Angelina National Forest for recent Pileated Woodpecker excavation and found that approximately 7.4% of all cavity trees were damaged while no control trees showed any evidence of Pileated Woodpecker damage. The rate of Pileated Woodpecker excavation was negatively associated with hardwood midstory height and density. Pileated Woodpeckers appeared to focus most of their excavations on Red-cockaded Woodpeckers cavity entrances. We suggest that Pileated Woodpeckers may be attracted to Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity trees, especially the cavity, and that midstory removal used to improve Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat may increase the incidence of damage to the cavity trees by Pileated Woodpeckers in the current fragmented landscape.

Lambert, F.R.; Collar, N.J.				Forktail	18			127-146	August 2002	2002				English	0	4	The lowland forests of the Sundaic region are disappearing at immense speed, and whatever survives of them will inevitably suffer the effects of internal degradation (from logging in particular) and of fragmentation. A review of the various studies of the impact of logging and fragmentation on the avifaunas of forested sites throughout the region consistently indicates that large areas of logged forest retain the majority of species present prior to logging, but that forest fragments - apparently even relatively large patches with a high proportion of primary forest - lose a significant number of species. Of 274 resident forest bird species confined to the lowlands of the Sundaic region (excluding Palawan), 83 (30% of the avifauna) are adversely affected by fragmentation and 26 (9.5%) negatively affected by logging, with forest-interior sallying insectivores, terrestrial insectivores and woodpeckers being particularly susceptible to both threats. In total, available data suggest that at least 91 and possibly 132+ species, or 33-50% of the lowland forest avifauna, respond negatively to the effects of these processes in some parts of their range. In the Sunda region, however, fragmentation would seem to be a much more serious threat to the survival of certain forest bird species than the selective logging of continuous forest. This conclusion suggests that the area of forest estate set aside for the production of timber is likely to have important (albeit secondary) conservation potential if (but only if) strict management regimes eliminate/ minimise fire, further clearance and penetration by settlers and hunters (and possibly only if contiguous areas of primary lowland forest are left intact).

Machmer, Marlene				U S Forest Service General Technical Report PSW	181			121-133	August 2002	2002				English	0	1	Long-term fire suppression and cessation of aboriginal burning has resulted in forest ingrowth and associated structural and functional changes to dry, fire-maintained forests of southeastern British Columbia. In this experimental study, effects of ecosystem restoration treatments (prescribed fire, partial harvesting, prescribed fire and partial harvesting, and untreated controls) on cavity-nesting birds, their habitat, and their insectivorous prey were investigated. Pre- and post-treatment data on the nesting density of cavity-nesters, the availability of wildlife trees, the foraging intensity of woodpeckers, and the relative abundance and species diversity of insects each breeding season were gathered, beginning in 1996. Preliminary results (1996 to 1998) indicate that harvested treatments were associated with a decline in the nesting density and species richness of cavity nesters over the short term; snag densities decreased in harvested and burned treatments; the number of trees per hectare with fresh woodpecker foraging sign did not differ significantly comparing pre- and post-treatment; and large increases in the relative abundance of selected insect species in some families were apparent in the treated units. Insect response was most pronounced in the burn only treatment, followed by the harvest and burn, and the harvest only treatments. Management implications for future ecosystem restoration efforts are discussed.

We modeled nest occurrence at the landscape scale by using Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. At both spatial scales, we observed a continuum in habitat use with the extremes represented by black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. A range of habitat conditions characteristic of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers would likely incorporate habitat features necessary for nest occurrence of other members in the cavity-nesting bird community.

Journal of Wildlife Management	66	3		641-661	July 2002	2002				English	2	35	The dramatic loss and degradation of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests in the southeastern United States have contributed to the declines of several bird species associated with this ecosystem. We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hard-woods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titmouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity of the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine sandhill forests.

Kirkpatrick, Chris; DeStefano, Stephen; Mannan, R. William; Lloyd, John				Southwestern Naturalist	47	2		282-292	June 2002	2002				English	0	16	We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997, 1998) a prescribed burn in a mesquite-invaded, desert grassland at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.

Provencher, Louis; Gobris, Nancy M.; Brennan, Leonard A.				Auk	119	1		71-87	January 2002	2002				English	1	17	Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

Kotliar, Natasha B.; Hejl, Sallie J.; Hutto, Richard L.; Saab, Victoria A.; Melcher, Cynthia P.; McFadzen, Mary E.				Studies in Avian Biology	25			49-64	2002	2002				English	3	29	Historically, fire was one of the most widespread natural disturbances in the western United States. More recently, however, significant anthropogenic activities, especially fire suppression and silvicultural practices, have altered fire regimes; as a result, landscapes and associated communities have changed as well. Herein, we review current knowledge of how fire and post-fire salvaging practices affect avian communities in conifer-dominated forests of the western United States. Specifically, we contrast avian communities in (1) burned vs. unburned forest, and (2) unsalvaged vs. salvage-logged burns. We also examine how variation in burn characteristics (e.g., severity, age, size) and salvage logging can alter avian communities in burns. Of the 41 avian species observed in three or more studies comparing early post-fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22% are consistently more abundant in burned forests, 34% are usually more abundant in unburned forests, and 44% are equally abundant in burned and unburned forests or have varied responses. In general, woodpeckers and aerial foragers are more abundant in burned forest, whereas most foliage-gleaning species are more abundant in unburned forests. Bird species that are frequently observed in stand-replacement burns are less common in understory burns; similarly, species commonly observed in unburned forests often decrease in abundance with increasing burn severity. Granivores and species common in open-canopy forests exhibit less consistency among studies. For all species, responses to fire may be influenced by a number of factors including burn severity, fire size and shape, proximity to unburned forests, pre- and post-fire cover types, and time since fire. In addition, post-fire management can alter species' responses to burns. Most cavity-nesting species do not use severely salvaged bums, whereas some cavity-nesters persist in partially salvaged burns. Early postfire specialists, in particular, appear to prefer unsalvaged burns. We discuss several alternatives to severe salvage-logging that will help provide habitat for cavity nesters. We provide an overview of critical research questions and design considerations crucial for evaluating the effects of prescribed fire and other anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest fragmentation. Management of native avifaunas may be most successful if natural disturbance regimes, including fire, are permitted to occur when possible. Natural fires could be augmented with practices, such as prescribed fire (including high-severity fire), that mimic inherent disturbance regimes.

Condor	103	3		491-501	August 2001	2001				English	1	17	Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) has been characterized as a "burn specialist" because of its preference for nesting within burned pine forests. No prior study, however, has demonstrated the relative importance of crown-burned forests to this woodpecker species by examining its reproductive success in different forest types. We studied breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success, productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types. Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46% (n=5) in cottonwood forests and 78% (n=283) in burned pine forests. Proportion of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood forests (34%) compared to burned pine forests (16%). We consistently found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were surrounded primarily by an agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape. Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems. Conditions created by crown fire may be equally important in maintaining ponderosa pine systems and conserving nesting habitat for the Lewis's Woodpecker.

Corales; Rubke, Rodrigo Lopez; Orellana, Sergio Alvarado				Boletin Chileno de Ornitologia	7			2-12	Diciembre 2000	2000				Spanish	0	0	During spring 1996 and summer 1997 we assessed the richness and relative abundance of birds in the Los Huemules del Niblinto Nature Sanctuary, a private protected area, located in the Andes of south-central Chile. We selected the five most representative environments: a coihue-roble forest (CRF), a pure lenga forest (PLF), a shrub-coihue sapling (CS), a nirre shrub (NS) and the Niblinto River (NR). In the CRF we registered 27 species being the Thorn-tailed Rayadito, White- crested Elaenia and Green-backed Firecrown the most frequent. In this habitat, we detected four species with conservation concern: Chilean Pigeon, Magellanic Woodpecker, Rufous-legged Owl and Chilean Bicolored Hawk. In the PLF we observed 10 species being Thorn-tailed Rayadito and Blue and White Swallow odominants. Twenty species were found in the CS being the Black-chinned Siskin dominant. In the NS we discovered 18 species being Thorn-tailed Rayadito the most frequent. Within this habitat, we registered five exclusive species: Bar-winged Cinclodes, Cinnamon-bellied Ground Tyrant, Ochre-naped Ground Tyrant, Rufous-backed Negrito and Yellow-bridled Finch. Along the Niblinto River we detected 10 species being Black-crowned Night Heron, Torrent Duck and Dark-bellied Cinclodes typical river-dwelling. The CFR, vegetationally the most complex, habitat had also the highest in bird richness. Total number of species was 41. In adittion, we added new occasional records of birds made in later expeditions, giving a total of 63 species for this Andean site.

Davis, Mark A.; Peterson, David W.; Reich, Peter B.; Crozier, Michelle; Query, Tony; Mitchell, Eliot; Huntington, Josh; Bazakas, Paul				Restoration Ecology	8	1		30-40	March 2000	2000				English	3	46	Restoration of many terrestrial plant communities involves the reintroduction of fire. However, there have been few studies of the effects of fire on the avifauna during the restoration process. To study the effects of oak savanna restoration on avian communities, breeding birds were censused and the vegetation structure documented in seven experimental burn units (8-18 ha) that had experienced different frequencies of controlled burns during the past 31 years (0-26 burns). Data were analyzed with both direct and indirect gradient analyses using multivariate techniques. The results showed that, as savanna restoration proceeded, there was a general decline in predominantly insectivorous species, particularly those that feed in the upper canopy region (leaves and air space), and a general increase in omnivorous species, particularly those that feed on the ground and in the lower canopy. Insectivorous bark gleaners (woodpeckers) also increased during restoration and were correlated with the increase in standing dead trees resulting from the fires. Overall, savanna restoration resulted in increases in the abundance of many open country bird species, including many species that have been declining in central and eastern North America, including red-headed woodpecker, Baltimore oriole, eastern kingbird, vesper sparrow, field sparrow, lark sparrow, brown thrasher, American goldfinch, and brown-headed cowbird. The shifts in species and guilds were correlated with changes in burn frequency and the macro vegetation structure-tree and shrub density, leaf area index, and relative proportion of standing dead trees. The findings show that savanna restoration can increase bird diversity and provide important habitat for uncommon or declining bird species.

Cooper, John M.; Beauchesne, Suzanne				Wildlife Working Report	WR-100			i-vii, 1-30	February 2000	2000				English	0	0	The East Kootenay Trench was surveyed for nesting Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) in June and July of 1997 and 1998. Forty-seven active nests were found the first year, and 85 were found the following year. These nests occurred in four habitat types: burned coniferous forest, open mature ponderosa pine forest, range land with isolated veteran ponderosa pines, and riparian cottonwood. Distribution of nests found was clumped, perhaps suggesting that preferred habitat was not randomly distributed. Nest trees were mainly burned ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir snags, large and dead veteran ponderosa pines, or live mature ponderosa pines; although western larch, black cottonwood, trembling aspen, paper birch, and utility poles were also used. Most nests were on Crown land, but in two areas (Wycliffe and Fairmont) nests were found predominantly on private land. The authors estimate that 100 to 150 pairs nest in the East Kootenay Trench, and suggest that good habitat is rare, that concentrations of nesting birds occur in burns, and that enhancement of habitat is feasible.

Powell, Larkin A.; Lang, Jason D.; Conroy, Michael J.; Krementz, David G.				Journal of Wildlife Management	64	1		11-23	January 2000	2000				English	0	21	Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 +- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +- 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.

Imbeau, Louis; Savard, Jean-Pierre L.; Gagnon, Rejean				Canadian Journal of Zoology	77	12		1850-1860	December 1999	1999				English	1	36	Comparisons of the effects of logging and fire as disturbance agents on the composition of bird assemblages in boreal ecosystems are still lacking or are limited to the short-term impacts of clear-cutting. In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

Hines, Martina				Journal of the Kentucky Academy of Science	60	2		78-86	Fall 1999	1999				English	0	1	Breeding-bird communities were surveyed on the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky, using point counts, in mid May, late May, and early June 1994 and 1995. Twenty-eight stands of Appalachian pine-oak forest were surveyed of which 14 were managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs). Management involved removal of midstories (2.5-17.5 cm dbh) and repeated prescribed burns. Results indicate that these management practices appear to have effects similar to that of timber harvests on species composition and abundance of breeding birds. Prescriptions for RCWs were beneficial to several species associated with early successional and edge habitat, including at least some neotropical migrants whose numbers are decreasing in eastern North America (e.g., indigo bunting, hooded warbler, and prairie warbler). Management for RCWs appears to decrease habitat quality for other neotropical migrants, particularly those associated with forest interiors.

Hobson, Keith A.; Schieck, Jim				Ecological Applications	9	3		849-863	August 1999	1999				English	2	101	A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having gtoreq95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest.

Krementz, David G.; Christie, Jeffrey S.				Journal of Wildlife Management	63	3		803-814	July 1999	1999				English	3	18	Public agencies are required to manage for threatened and endangered species and for biodiversity. However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, "recruitment" stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996; 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05).

Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.	Kreisel, Karen J.; 2802 W.

Journal of Field Ornithology	69	1		109-116	Winter 1998	1998				English	0	4	We quantified habitat use of nesting Lewis' Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) in southeastern Wyoming on an 11,100-ha study area consisting of scattered ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. A 1295-ha burn in 1974 and a 1590-ha burn in 1986 occurred prior to the study. Our results showed nest sites occurred in burned areas, which had more ground cover and downed logs. Birds were found in sites where visual obstruction of the sky including vegetation and burned branches was higher than non-use areas. Ninety-eight percent of nests were surrounded by burned ponderosa pine. We found 74% of the nest trees on north- to east-facing slopes. Nests occurred in clumps rather than randomly throughout the habitat. Human disturbance did not appear to be a factor in nest placement and nest trees typically did not differ in height from surrounding trees. Our results also showed that Lewis' Woodpecker nests were more common in the later burn (1986) than in the earlier burn (1974).

Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4		1359-1372	October 1998	1998				English	2	50	Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986.

Aigner, Paul A.; Block, William M.; Morrison, Michael L.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	2		485-496	April 1998	1998				English	1	7	Despite a history of oak clearing and thinning in California, little is known about the effects of firewood harvesting on wildlife in oak woodlands. We studied the effect of firewood harvesting on population trends of birds during the breeding season in an oak-pine woodland in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada, California. During fall-winter of 1993-94, total tree basal area on 30 3.1-ha study plots was reduced by approximately 23% via removal of commercial-grade oaks, but all old-growth trees and trees with obvious nest cavities or woodpecker granaries were preserved. An additional 30 plots represented controls. We used point counts to derive a population index of birds 1 breeding season before and 2 breeding seasons after harvesting. We detected population shifts in 14 species (7 year-round residents, 4 breeding migrants, 1 migrant, 2 winter residents), of which 10 showed consistent population increases, 2 showed consistent population decreases, and 2 showed varying population changes in the 2 seasons after harvesting. Six of the species that increased on harvested plots appeared to respond to the presence of brush piles. Responses of other species were less clearly linked to a particular aspect of vegetation change. Although we found a negative effect of harvesting on only 2 species, the Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) and Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), statistical power to detect anything less than total extirpation of many uncommon species was <0.8. Our results indicate that small-scale firewood harvests that reduce basal area by <25% and preserve nest cavities and granary trees have minimal negative short-term effects on most of the more common bird species present during the breeding season, but we caution that effects on uncommon species may have gone undetected.

Hess, Charles A.; James, Frances C.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	2		509-517	April 1998	1998				English	1	11	Most territories of the largest population of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis; RCWs) in the western district of the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) do not meet the current foraging-habitat requirements in the recovery plan for this species. We suspect that more information about the relation between the diet of the RCW and its habitat is needed and would permit development of better guidelines for the ANF and other populations. We studied diets of adult and nestling RCWs and their relation to variation in habitat. We found that ants were the dominant prey item by biomass (58%). Additional major items in stomachs of adult RCWs were other arthropods, fruits and seeds, and wood. Of the 4 species of ants present in samples, 74% of the biomass consisted of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of the arboreal ant Crematogaster ashmeadi. Territories burned more frequently had pine trees (Pinus spp.) with a higher diversity of ant species and lower proportions of trees occupied by C. ashmeadi than did territories burned less frequently. Also, stomach samples from adult male woodpeckers at frequently burned sites had lower proportions of ants, including C. ashmeadi. More information is needed about the dynamics of interspecific relations within arthropod communities of longleaf pine trees (P. palustris), the importance of ants to the ecology of the RCW, and the relevance of variation in habitat to diets of RCWs.

Masters, Ronald E.; Lochmiller, Robert L.; McMurry, Scott T.; Bukenhofer, George A.				Wildlife Society Bulletin	26	1		148-158	Spring 1998	1998				English	0	16	The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the fire-dependent shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-grassland community on the Ouachita National Forest and potentially >780,000 ha of the pine-grassland community throughout the Southeast to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse (P. leucopus)) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.

Plentovich, Sheldon; Tucker, James W., Jr; Holler, Nicholas R.; Hill, Geoffrey E.				Journal of Wildlife Management	62	1		347-354	January 1998	1998				English	2	19	Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) use mature pine woodlands characterized by well-spaced pines, an open midstory, and a dense understory of grasses and forbs. Populations of the Bachman's sparrow began declining in the 1930s, with both a dramatic retraction in geographic distribution and the extinction of many local populations. Current land management practices in the southeastern United States often focus on the habitat requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker without considering other species with similar habitat requirements (i.e., Bachman's sparrow). We examined habitat requirements of the Bachman's sparrow on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to determine if management practices directed at recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers are providing Bachman's sparrows with suitable habitat. Comparisons between active red-cockaded woodpecker clusters occupied (n = 8) and unoccupied (n = 13) by Bachman's sparrows showed that Bachman's sparrows selected areas with a dense understory of grasses and sparse midstory vegetation. Areas suitable for red-cockaded woodpeckers were not always suitable for Bachman's sparrows. Red-cockaded woodpeckers appear more tolerant of a hardwood midstory and do not require a dense cover of grasses and forbs. Prescribed burning is key for development and maintenance of the dense herbaceous understory preferred by Bachman's sparrow. In areas managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers, frequent (3-5 yr) burning early in the growing season appears the best way to increase habitat suitability for Bachman's sparrows.

Conner, Richard N.; Dickson, James G.				Texas Journal of Science	49	3	(Supplement)	123-138	August 1997	1997				English	1	8	Bird communities of the West Gulf Coastal Plain are strongly influenced by the stage of forest succession, species composition of understory and overstory vegetation, and forest structure. Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities.

James, Frances C.; Hess, Charles A.; Kufrin, Dubravka				Ecological Applications	7	1		118-129	February 1997	1997				English	3	53	"Species-centered Environmental Analysis" (SCEA) is a procedure for diagnosing species-specific environmental factors that limit the size of a population. It attempts to identify presently recognized biotic and abiotic limiting factors. Then, through comparisons and applications of the principles of experimental design, it evaluates the relative importance of the factors and searches for new ones. The advantage of SCEA is that it frames ecological hypotheses in a context that spans population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes while keeping the research focused on ecological factors that directly or indirectly affect the size of a focal population. In the case of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which lives in mature pine forests of the southeastern United States, four types of environmental factors have been shown to limit its numbers, even on public land: (1) insufficient habitat due to hardwood midstory encroachment, (2) a shortage of suitable cavity trees, (3) loss and fragmentation of habitat, and (4) demographic isolation. As part of the research to identify other potentially limiting environmental factors in the Apalachicola National Forest of northern Florida, we studied a sample of 87 social units (each unit usually a mated pair of birds with or without helpers, but sometimes a single bird). Each unit was defending a cluster of cavity trees and a foraging territory of open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. We then developed regression models for predicting within-population variation in the size, density, and productivity of social units from data on habitat variation. We found that variation in the bird variables was not significantly related to the sizes or densities of pine trees in these territories. It was, however, highly significantly related to the ground cover composition and the extent of natural pine regeneration, both of which are indirect indicators of local fire history.

Hipes, Dan L.; Jackson, Dale R.				Florida Scientist	59	2		96-114	Spring 1996	1996				English	0	3	Camp Blanding Training Site (CBTS) is a Florida Department of Military Affairs Army National Guard facility encompassing 29,500 ha in western Clay County, northeastern Florida. Land use is divided principally among military training, timber management, and support facilities. CBTS supports a diverse though disturbed landscape of upland, palustrine, and lacustrine natural communities, with xeric to mesic pineland communities predominating. CBTS is within or approached by the ranges of at least 40 rare vertebrate species, as well as several rare invertebrates and vascular plants. We conducted a 13-month survey during 1993-1994 to determine the presence and distribution of rare amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals at CBTS, with additional limited aquatic sampling focusing on fishes and one rare crayfish. We observed 18 species of rare vertebrates at CBTS, including substantial populations of the striped newt, gopher frog, gopher tortoise, red-cockaded woodpecker, southeastern American kestrel, Bachman's sparrow, Florida mouse, and Sherman's fox squirrel. Most of the rare vertebrates at CBTS are members of two communities naturally dominated by longleaf pine sbd sandhills and longleaf pine flatwoods sbd or the isolated wetlands contained within them. Unfortunately, remaining tracts of longleaf pine are generally in marginal condition as a result of years of fire suppression that have allowed extensive invasion by hardwood species. Appropriate management of these habitats should include their gradual return to uneven-aged forests dominated by longleaf pine, with prescribed growing season fires used to promote native ground-cover production while suppressing hardwood encroachment. Despite decades of past land management practices that often have been incompatible with the maintenance of native communities, CBTS nonetheless retains a significant component of biodiversity native to this region.

Hutto, Richard L.				Conservation Biology	9	5		1041-1058	October 1995	1995				English	1	60	During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations.

Restoration and management techniques include wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and codominant trees) and prescribed fire. We evaluated how habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird species. We compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control, whereas species richness did not differ (P = 0.399) among treatments. Densities of ground/ shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire. Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P lt 0.001) in untreated stands than in treated stands. Restoration efforts may be beneficial to neotropical migrant species such as eastern woodpewee (Contopus virens) and prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), in addition to declining species of regional interest such as red-cockaded woodpecker, Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that depend upon pine-grassland habitats.

Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Pletschet, Sandra M.; Leslie, David M., Jr				American Midland Naturalist	132	2		275-283	October 1994	1994				English	0	7	A search of 4600 ha of the McCurtain County Wilderness Area (MCWA), Oklahoma, in 1989-1990 yielded 15 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km-2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km-2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km-2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926. Re-establishment of a fire regime is important in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its red-cockaded woodpecker population.

American Midland Naturalist	127	2		233-240	1992	1992				English	0	6	Bird densities within coastal scrub and slash pine flatwoods were compared with time since fire, mean shrub height, number of snags and percent burn. Most shrub-dwelling birds preferred older stands (> 10 yr since last fire) with taller shrubs, or intermediate stands (4 yr since last fire) than recently burned stands (1-2 yr since last fire). Five species were negatively correlated with percent burn in stands burned 1-2 yr previously. The downy woodpecker was most abundant in recently burned areas. Densities of three species of woodpeckers and the northern bobwhite were positively correlated with snag density. The results suggest that extensive burns occurring every 4 yr or less are likely to have a negative influence on shrub-dwelling birds that are a natural component of these coastal communities.

Dickson, James G.				Natural Areas Journal	11	1		26-33	January 1991	1991				English	0	4	Most early accounts of pre-Colonial southern forests present a picture of a diverse forest with a variety of tree ages, interspersed with openings. There were many old and decayed trees, down logs, and abundnat mast. The forest were dynamic, changing with plant succession and influenced by numerous other factors such as fire, insects, disease, ice and wind storms, flooding and activities of native Americans. Most early accounts describe a plethora of wildlife in the diverse forests. Bird communities were abundant and diverse, probably with numerous cavity nesters and species associated with mature forests. The passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet, once abundant and widely distributed in these forests, are extinct today. Early records reveal that the eastern wild turkey was abundant enough to be a food staple for early settlers. The red-cockaded woodpecker was probably abundant in the frequently burned longleaf pine forests of the Southeast. Squirrels and white-tailed deer were abundant in the diverse forests. Deer were a diet staple of native Americans and the hides became a major item of commerce. Large carnivores, such as black bears and cougars, were relatively abundant.

Wildlife Society Bulletin	19	3		277-286	1991	1991				English	0	4	Using a repeated survey of randomly selected management compartments in FMNF, we estimated there were 427 clans of red-cockaded woodpeckers in 1980-1981 and 470 clans in 1987-1988. We inferred from the repeated surveys that this population increase of 10.1% over a 7-year period was significant (P < 0.05). Our inference was supported by (1) documentation of colonization (new clans using new colony sites) in both surveyed and nonsurveyed compartments; (2) an actual increase in number of clans in surveyed compartments; and (3) an actual increase in the number of clans in a group of nonsurveyed compartments. Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites < 400 m to 2,440 m from an adjacent colony. Two of these 14 colonizations were observed to be formed by pioneering, and were 520 m and 1,530 m from another colony. Either pioneering or budding was suspected in the formation of the 12 remaining new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: (1) a large inventory of pine sawtimber, (2) availability of old trees for cavity excavation, (3) control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, (4) protection of cavity trees, and (5) provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually. This loss was thought to be caused by encroachment of hardwood and pine midstories around cavity trees.

Auk	107	3		463-472	1990	1990				English	0	3	Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) has declined over much of its range in the last fifty years. To understand the role of habitat loss in this decline, we examined patterns of habitat occupancy by this species in two areas of South Carolina [USA]. At both sites we recorded relatively high densities of breeding sparrows in mature (> 80 yr old) pine stands, and relatively low densities in young pine stands. Habitat occupancy varied between sites in clearcuts and middle-aged pine stands. Sparrows used areas with open understories and dense ground covers of grasses and forbs. Habitat occupancy differed between the two main study areas because these preferred vegetation characteristics were found in different habitats in the two areas. Timber management practices (especially burning rotations, site-preparation techniques, and thinning) have a strong effect on understory vegetation and, therefore, habitat suitability for the sparrow. Management practices that produce suitable habitat for Re-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) also provide habitat for Bachman's Sparrow. We believe that, even though the sparrow may use open habitats that appear to be relatively common, its habitat requirements are relatively strict, and that habitat loss may be an important factor in this species' population decline.

Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science	69			27-31	1989	1989				English	0	0	The current status of the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picioides borealis) in Oklahoma was evaluated from 1985 to 1987. Colony sites found by Wood (16) were visited and 51.4% were inactive. Annual mortality of cavity trees ranged from 5.2 to 6.8%. Red-cockaded woodpecker populations in Oklahoma appear to have declined because of land-use change. Population decline on the McCurtain County Wilderness Area is attributed to plant succession beyond previous fire disclimax. Reintroduction of fire in the Wilderness Area will be necessary to restore the species habitat to its former status. The first known occurrence of range expansion, in Oklahoma, following re-establishment of suitable habitat is also reported here.

Rivista Italiana di Ornitologia	55	1-2		3-26	1985	1985				English	0	0	The Authors have studied the Corsican Nuthatch Sitta whiteheadi for 4 consecutive breeding seasons (1981-84). They have assessed its distribution, status and ecological preferences during the reproductive period, aiming at a better knowledge of this bird, in view of its effective conservation in the future. The species seems to be strictly associated with old forests of Pinus laricio and numbers approximately 2000 pairs in total; such a low value stresses once more the need for protection of this small population, as well as a correct management of its natural biotope. Among the limiting factors playing an important role, the following ones should be mentioned: the predation on pulli by the Great Spotted Woodpecker Picoides major; the pine forest fires and tree felling which lead to the alteration and contraction of the habitat, a decrease in numbers and even the disappearance of the Nuthatch from portions of its former range.
