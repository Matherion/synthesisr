AB  - Human activities impact upon natural habitats used by birds for breeding and foraging, and lead to changes in the composition and spatial distribution of predator communities, mainly through loss, fragmentation and disturbance of formerly pristine habitat. Yet possible fitness consequences of such changes through impacts on bird nest-site selection remain poorly known. Here we study nest-site selection and reproductive success of Placid Greenbuls Phyllastrephus placidus in the Taita Hills, southeast Kenya. We show that habitat features associated with nest-site selection by this insectivorous, open-cup-nesting bird species vary among forest fragments that are exposed to different levels of habitat disturbance. Such differences in sites selected for breeding result from a plastic response to fragment-specific conditions or may be driven by fragment-specific variation in the distribution and availability of certain habitat features. Given the overall high nest predation rates in our study area, we expected variation in nest-site selection to correlate with reproductive success and nestling condition, but detected no such relationship. Because predator density and nest predation rates may vary strongly in space and time, a better understanding of spatio-temporal variation in predator communities is needed to assess the possible adaptive value of nest-site selection strategies for reducing the high predation rates that are typical for this and many other open-cup-nesting tropical passerines. © 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union

AB  - Habitat destruction is the single greatest anthropogenic threat to biodiversity. Decades of research on this issue have led to the accumulation of hundreds of data sets comparing species assemblages in larger, intact, habitats to smaller, more fragmented, habitats. Despite this, little synthesis or consensus has been achieved, primarily because of non-standardized sampling methodology and analyses of notoriously scale-dependent response variables (i.e., species richness). To be able to compare and contrast the results of habitat fragmentation on species’ assemblages, it is necessary to have the underlying data on species abundances and sampling intensity, so that standardization can be achieved. To accomplish this, we systematically searched the literature for studies where abundances of species in assemblages (of any taxa) were sampled from many habitat patches that varied in size. From these, we extracted data from several studies, and contacted authors of studies where appropriate data were collected but not published, giving us 117 studies that compared species assemblages among habitat fragments that varied in area. Less than one-half (41) of studies came from tropical forests of Central and South America, but there were many studies from temperate forests and grasslands from all continents except Antarctica. Fifty-four of the studies were on invertebrates (mostly insects), but there were several studies on plants (15), birds (16), mammals (19), and reptiles and amphibians (13). We also collected qualitative information on the length of time since fragmentation. With data on total and relative abundances (and identities) of species, sampling effort, and affiliated meta-data about the study sites, these data can be used to more definitively test hypotheses about the role of habitat fragmentation in altering patterns of biodiversity.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for tropical biodiversity conservation. Expansion of commodity crops, such as oil palm, fragments natural habitat areas, and strategies are needed to improve habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) voluntary certification system requires that growers identify and conserve forest patches identified as High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) before oil palm plantations can be certified as sustainable. We assessed the potential benefits of these conservation set-asides for forest connectivity. We mapped HCVAs and quantified their forest cover in 2015. To assess their contribution to forest connectivity, we modelled range expansion of forest-dependent populations with five dispersal abilities spanning those representative of poor dispersers (e.g. flightless insects) to more mobile species (e.g. large birds or bats) across 70 plantation landscapes in Borneo. Because only 21% of HCVA area was forested in 2015, these conservation set-asides currently provide few connectivity benefits. Compared to a scenario where HCVAs contain no forest (i.e. a no-RSPO scenario), current HCVAs improved connectivity by ~3% across all dispersal abilities. However, if HCVAs were fully reforested, then overall landscape connectivity could improve by ~16%. Reforestation of HCVAs had the greatest benefit for poor to intermediate dispersers (0.5–3 km per generation), generating landscapes that were up to 2.7 times better connected than landscapes without HCVAs. By contrast, connectivity benefits of HCVAs were low for highly mobile populations under current and reforestation scenarios, because range expansion of these populations was generally successful regardless of the amount of forest cover. Synthesis and applications. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) requires that High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) be set aside to conserve biodiversity, but HCVAs currently provide few connectivity benefits because they contain relatively little forest. However, reforested HCVAs have the potential to improve landscape connectivity for some forest species (e.g. winged insects), and we recommend active management by plantation companies to improve forest quality of degraded HCVAs (e.g. by enrichment planting). Future revisions to the RSPO's Principles and Criteria should also ensure that large (i.e. with a core area '2 km2) HCVAs are reconnected to continuous tracts of forest to maximize their connectivity benefits. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The value of novel native broadleaf woodlands for biodiversity conservation is important to consider for adequate forest management in rural landscapes. Passive reforestation has been proposed as a cost-efficient tool for creating networks of novel native forest stands that would help restoring biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Yet to date the ecological functioning of such stands remains strongly understudied compared to forest remnants resulting from longer-term fragmentation. We assessed how the size and connectivity of newly established Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stands in rural landscapes of SW France affect rates of herbivory by different insect guilds as well as rates of avian insectivory and the abundance and richness of insectivorous birds. Comparing 18 novel forest stands along a gradient of size (0.04–1.15 ha) and cover of broadleaf forests in the surroundings (0–30% within a 500 m radius), we found that even the smallest stands are colonised by leaf miners and chewers/skeletonizers, and that rates of herbivory are globally comparable to those reported from older and larger oak forests. The size of stands had a relatively minor effect on herbivory, whereas it increased the abundance of insectivorous bird. It also determined rates of avian insectivory as estimated by an experiment with plasticine caterpillars. These rates were however rather low and unrelated with the extent of herbivory in the stand. Overall, our study indicates that insect herbivores tend to react more rapidly to the establishment of novel native forests than their avian predators as the latter may depend on the development of larger patches of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. To favour a rapid build-up of diverse, and hence stable, trophic networks involving insect herbivores and their predators, woodland creation schemes should therefore primarily focus on habitat size and quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and forestry practices affect forest structure and composition, and hence, their intrinsic value for biodiversity conservation. While higher tree species diversity is commonly proposed to result in habitat of higher quality for forest species, how these tree diversity and tree composition effects interact with forest fragmentation in terms of critical resources and demographic effects on forest birds remains poorly understood. We investigated here possible synergistic effects of forest fragmentation and tree species composition on the breeding performance of two common, insectivorous forest birds in a human-dominated landscape in northern Belgium. We monitored the breeding performance of Great Tits and Blue Tits in 53 plots across independent gradients of tree species composition and forest fragmentation. In addition, data on the biomass of the main food source of these two species (i.e. caterpillars) was collected during the breeding season. Both tree composition and habitat fragmentation impacted the breeding performance of Great and Blue Tits. Effects of tree species composition were mainly driven by tree species identity, rather than by tree species diversity, and the highest breeding performance was obtained in monocultures of Pedunculate Oaks. Fragmentation effects were only observed in resource-poor Beech monocultures with breeding performance declining with reduction in forest area. Structural Equation Modelling revealed diverse and species-specific pathways: for Great Tits tree composition effects on breeding performance were driven by resource availability while for Blue Tits these effects were driven by variation in clutch size. Thus, forestry practices aiming at promoting forest-dependent birds could benefit from including tree species that support high arthropod numbers and by maintaining forest patches of larger sizes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To better understand natural regeneration of trees and forest dynamics it is important to gain insight into the drivers of invertebrate herbivory. In mature forests, associational resistance of trees resulting from a high diversity of neighbouring trees is common, and can have cascading effects on tree growth through resource concentration effects or through changes in top-down control. While the underlying biological processes are known to be influenced by the forest's spatial properties, we lack insights on how resource concentration, top-down control and fragmentation jointly affect sapling performance in fragmented landscapes. We therefore experimentally quantified effects of the proportion of conspecific trees in the overstorey (resource concentration), avian top-down control (natural enemies) and distance to the forest edge on invertebrate herbivory levels and sapling growth. The assessments were made on planted saplings of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur and Quercus rubra in 53 experimental plots and birds were excluded by means of exclosures from a subset of these saplings. Excluding avian top-down control increased herbivory on each tree species. Increased herbivory led to decreased sapling growth in F. sylvatica and Q. rubra. On Q. robur saplings, top-down control was stronger closer to the forest edge. Furthermore, in this species, herbivory inside the exclosures increased with an increasing proportion of conspecific trees in the overstorey, while such a resource concentration effect was not observed outside the exclosures. Our results show the importance for forest management of conserving insectivorous birds and promoting a mixed overstorey, which can decrease sapling herbivory when bird abundance is low. More generally, our study provides insight into the complex, multitrophic interactions that drive sapling growth in forest stands located within fragmented landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Proposed mechanisms for the decline of terrestrial and understory insectivorous birds in the tropics include a related subset that together has been termed the ‘microclimate hypothesis’. One prediction from this hypothesis is that sensitivity to bright light environments discourages birds of the dimly lit rainforest interior from using edges, gaps, or disturbed forest. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and capture data across time and space, we tested this by first determining vulnerability based on differences in within-species capture rates between disturbed and undisturbed forest for 64 bird species at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonian Brazil. We found that 35 species (55%) were vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat degradation, whereas only four (6%) were more commonly captured in degraded forest. To infer visual sensitivity, we then examined two different characters: eye size (maximum pupil diameter) relative to body mass and the initiation time of dawn song, which presumably reflects a species’ visual capacity under low light intensities. We predicted that species with large relative eye sizes and birds with earlier dawn songs would exhibit increased vulnerability in degraded habitats with bright light. Contrary to our predictions, however, vulnerability was positively correlated with the mean start time of dawn song. This indicates that species that wait to initiate dawn song are also more vulnerable to habitat degradation. After correcting for body size, there was no effect of eye size on vulnerability. Together, our results do not provide quantitative support for the light sensitivity mechanism of the microclimate hypothesis. More sensitive experimental tests, such as behavioral assays with controlled light environments, especially in a comparative framework, are needed to rigorously evaluate the role of light sensitivity as an aspect of the microclimate hypothesis among Neotropical birds. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Tropical agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss, yet it can provide conservation opportunities, especially where protected areas are inadequate. To investigate the long-term biodiversity capacity of agricultural countryside, we quantified bird population trends in Costa Rica by mist netting 57,255 birds of 265 species between 1999 and 2010 in sun coffee plantations, riparian corridors, secondary forests, forest fragments, and primary forest reserves. More bird populations (69) were declining than were stable (39) or increasing (4). Declines were common in resident, insectivorous, and more specialized species. There was no relationship between the species richness of a habitat and its conservation value. High-value forest bird communities were characterized by their distinct species composition and habitat and dietary functional signatures. While 49% of bird species preferred forest to coffee, 39% preferred coffee to forest and 12% used both habitats, indicating that coffee plantations have some conservation value. Coffee plantations, although lacking most of the forest specialists, hosted 185 bird species, had the highest capture rates, and supported increasing numbers of some forest species. Coffee plantations with higher tree cover (7% vs. 13%) had more species with increasing capture rates, twice as many forest specialists, and half as many nonforest species. Costa Rican countryside habitats, especially those with greater tree cover, host many bird species and are critical for connecting bird populations in forest remnants. Diversified agricultural landscapes can enhance the biodiversity capacity of tropical countryside, but, for the long-term persistence of all forest bird species, large (>1,000 ha) protected areas are essential. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Forest harvesting reduces mean stand age and dead wood amount. Among species dependent upon older forests and dead wood, primary excavators such as woodpeckers play an important ecological role by providing cavities for many other species. Conservation of these species thus requires striking a balance between timber harvesting and dead wood supply, especially under moderate natural disturbance regimes. In this study, we quantified habitat use in two closely-related, sympatric species: Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and American Three-toed (P. dorsalis) Woodpecker, in the highlands of northern New Brunswick, Canada. Natural fires are rare in this ecoregion and forest harvesting is the main agent of landscape change, along with infrequent outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Based on its habitat use patterns in other ecoregions, we hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpecker would select nest sites in mature coniferous forest stands and we expected that it would achieve a higher nest survival rate in forest stands than within, or at the edge of, cutblocks. Owing to sample size limitations for American Three-toed Woodpecker, statistical analyses were restricted to its occurrence patterns. Both species co-occurred, and there was no difference in detectability following conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. Contrary to our prediction, Black-backed Woodpecker selected nest sites with higher proportions of recently cut areas within 50 m than at randomly selected sites. Black-backed Woodpecker selected cutblocks for nesting when suitable snags were available and mature forest stands were present nearby as foraging habitat. For the species to persist in this landscape, the supply of snags must be continuous and forest stands must be sufficiently mature to host saproxylic insects. © 2019

AB  - Aim: To test whether the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands induced by a major hydroelectric dam is best explained by either the island biogeography theory (IBT) or the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH). Given the low dispersal ability of the focal species group and the hostile water matrix, we predict that the species richness will be predominantly driven by an island effect as posited by the IBT, rather than a sample area effect as posited by the HAH. Location: Forest islands within the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, central Brazilian Amazonia. Taxon: Birds. Methods: We mist-netted birds at 33 forest islands (0.63–1,699 ha), totalling 874 individuals of 59 species. The size of the local landscape used to calculate the habitat amount was determined by a multi-scale analysis in which buffers around mist-net lines ranged from 50 to 2,000 m. We applied four tests to examine whether the species richness on forest islands is predominantly driven by either an island effect (island size) or a sample area effect (habitat amount). Results: From the four tests applied, one was consistent with an island effect, two were regarded as inappropriate to test the HAH, and one could not be adequately addressed due to island size being highly correlated with habitat amount in the local landscape (200-m buffer). Main conclusions: Some of the proposed ways of testing the HAH may lead to misleading conclusions. The relative importance of island size in determining the species richness of understorey insectivorous birds on forest islands is higher than that of surrounding habitat amount, thereby providing stronger support for IBT. We propose a conceptual framework, based on the degree of matrix permeability and species dispersal ability, to determine to what extent a patch- or landscape-centric worldview in landscape ecology provides the most appropriate framework to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - There is an increase in damage caused by biotic agents in the forests of Central Europe. One of the choices for protecting forests against insect pests is the ability to use the biological protection of the birds of family Picidae. They are able to effectively control pests and indirectly promote the occurrence of another beneficial animal species. We dealt with three species with different habitat requirements: three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). In general, they can halve the amount of the pest population. The three-toed woodpecker feeds mainly on bark beetles and longhorn beetles. It needs a large amount of dead wood, which almost excludes its presence in production forests. Other species do not have so many environmental demands. The black woodpecker is tied to larger forest complexes, including production forests. The great spotted woodpecker is able to colonise even small fragments of forests. Economic loss caused by nest holes excavating and hunting of wood boring insect are negligible. Holes have a small volume and are mostly created in already damaged wood. The presence of woodpeckers in production forests is desirable, and it should be encouraged by keeping enough amount of dead and cavity trees. © 2019, Forestry and Game Management Research Institute.

AB  - Studies reporting specific aspects of forest tinamous’ feeding ecology are still scarce in the scientific literature, and most of the available information report only casual observations. The Crypturellus noctivagus noctivagus (Tinamiformes, Tinamidae) is a forest bird endemic to Brazil, which occurs from southern Bahia to Rio Grande do Sul. In this study, we analyzed food items found in the stomach content of one C. n. noctivagus individual in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We found seeds of Nectandra megapotamica (Laurales, Lauraceae) and Myrcianthes gigantea (Myrtales, Myrtaceae), totalizing 2.259 g. We also found insect fragments of the orders Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, one individual of the family Curculionidae (Coleoptera), and one larval specimen of Dirphia muscosa (Lepdoptera), totalizing 0.637 g of stomach content, and rock fragments weight 1.741 g. This study provides records of the C. n. noctivagus species feeding habits, contributing to the knowledge about the trophic ecology of Tinamiformes in South Brazil. © 2019, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

AB  - With the rapid growth of agricultural areas globally, forest birds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes in which forest patches are surrounded by an agricultural plantation matrix, yet how birds respond behaviourally to this fragmentation is poorly understood. Information on microhabitat requirements of birds is scarce, but nevertheless essential to predicting adaptation of bird species to the patchy landscapes. We investigated foraging patterns of three tropical insectivorous birds, Green Iora Aegithina viridissima, Pin-striped Tit-Babbler Macronus gularis and Chestnut-winged Babbler Cyanoderma erythropterum, to determine whether they vary in foraging methods in different forest patches. Our study area encompassed old-logged lowland forest; one continuous forest and three forest patches. Observations were performed for 15 days every month for a period of 13 months. Information on foraging height, substrate, attack manoeuvres, and foliage density was collected independently for each foraging bird individual. All three species used different foraging substrates and attack manoeuvres in different habitat types. The Green Iora frequently used lower strata when foraging in forest patches as opposed to continuous forest, while the Pin-striped Tit-Babbler tended to forage in more dense vegetation in patches. Only Chestnut-winged Babbler displayed complete foraging plasticity across all study parameters. Different habitat features (e.g., edges, microclimates) between continuous forest and forest patches significantly influenced the foraging strategies of the study species. These changes in foraging strategies suggest that some Malaysian forest birds (e.g. generalist species) can respond behaviourally to fragmentation and habitat loss. Although continuous forest has critically important characteristics that need to be conserved, remnant forest patches are also important as ecological movement corridors and foraging grounds for birds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: An entomological study was conducted in the municipality of Oiapoque (lower Oyapock River Basin) in the Brazilian side bordering French Guiana to gain information on the transmission pattern of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in that region, presumed to reflect the classical Amazonian/Guianan enzootic scenario. Methods: Three ecologically isolated forested areas near urban environments were surveyed during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016, using a multi-trapping approach comprising ground-level and canopy light traps, black and white colored cloth Shannon traps and manual aspiration on tree bases. Female phlebotomines were dissected to find infections and isolate flagellates from Leishmania spp. The strains were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and compared with those of local ACL cases and World Health Organization reference strains. Results: Nyssomyia umbratilis, Trichopygomyia trichopyga and Evandromyia infraspinosa were the most frequently found species. Findings on relative abundance, spatiotemporal vector/ACL congruence, natural infections and anthropophilic insights strengthened the Guianan classical transmission of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis by Ny. umbratilis and suggested further investigations for Ev. infraspinosa. Nyssomyia umbratilis showed an eclectic feeding habit, including bird blood. Ecological data and literature reports also included Psychodopygus squamiventris maripaensis and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata on the list of suspected vectors. Conclusions: These findings contributed to understanding ACL ecoepidemiology in the Amazonian/Guianan scenario. Local studies are required to better comprehend the Leishmania spp. enzootic mosaic in specific ecotopes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Riparian ecosystems are suffering anthropogenic threats that reduce biodiversity and undermine ecosystem services. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the way species composition of assemblages is related to ecosystem function, especially in a landscape fragmentation context. Here, we assess the impact of habitat loss and disturbance on Functional Diversity (FD) components Functional Redundancy (FRed), Functional Evenness (FEve), and Functional Richness (FRic) of riparian forest bird assemblages to evaluate (a) how FD components respond to riparian forest width reduction and vegetation disturbance; (b) the existence of thresholds within these relationships; (c) which of the main birds diet guild (frugivores, insectivores, and omnivores) respond to such thresholds. We predict that FD components will be affected negatively and nonlinearly by riparian changes. However, guilds could have different responses due to differences of species sensitivity to fragmentation and disturbance. We expect to find thresholds in FD responses, because fragmentation and disturbance drive loss of specific FD components. Our results show that FRed and FEve were linearly affected by width and disturbance of riparian habitats, respectively. FRed was significantly lower in riparian forests assemblages below 400 m wide, and FEve was significantly higher above 60% disturbance. These responses of FD were also followed to the decline in insectivores and frugivores richness in riparian forests most affected by these changes. Consequently, our study suggests communities do not tolerate reduction in riparian forest width or disturbance intensification without negative impact on FD, and this becomes more critical for riparian area <400-m wide or with more than 60% disturbance. This minimum riparian width required to maintain FRed is greater than the minimum width required for riparian forests by Brazilian law. Thus, it is important to consider mechanisms to expand riparian habitats and reduce the disturbance intensity in riparian forests so that riparian bird community FD may be effectively conserved. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Wildlife-friendly agricultural practices, such as agroforestry, can play an important role in conserving biodiversity by providing and connecting habitat across working landscapes. Silvopastures (i.e. pastures with substantial tree cover), in particular, possess considerable potential for conserving biodiversity due to the dominance of pastoral landscapes in many regions. However, to balance tradeoffs between the conservation and agricultural values of these anthropogenic systems, better information on wildlife use and how it relates to habitat quality is needed. To improve our mechanistic understanding of silvopastoral habitat quality, and to develop management recommendations, we evaluated the foraging behavior of insectivorous forest birds in Andean silvopastures compared with forest fragments. Focal species' prey attack rates were >25% lower in silvopastures than in forest fragments, suggesting that arthropod prey were less abundant or accessible in silvopastures than in forest fragments. In forest fragments, birds in mixed-species foraging flocks attacked prey more frequently than solitary birds. In silvopastures, flocking and solitary birds attacked prey at similar rates, and birds foraged in flocks half as frequently as in forest fragments. Insectivorous birds preferentially foraged in a small subset of tree genera in forest fragments, but did not exhibit selective foraging in less botanically diverse silvopastures. Insectivorous species that used silvopastures foraged in microhabitats such as vine tangles and hanging dead leaves less frequently than species that did not use silvopastures. Forest species that used silvopastures may have been negatively affected by a breakdown of beneficial interspecific interactions in silvopastures, highlighting the potential for cascading effects of species loss in anthropogenic habitats. Managing silvopastures to include preferred tree species and microhabitats could improve their habitat quality for forest species, but strategies to enhance the conservation value of managed landscapes with silvopastures must also include preservation of forest fragments. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

AB  - Habitat destruction due to human land-use activities is well recognized as a central threat to biodiversity. However, there is still debate about the relative influence of its two components, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, mostly because few studies have been able to disentangle their respective effects. We studied mechanisms by which habitat destruction might influence the prevalence of vector-transmitted haemosporidian blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infecting the Lesser Antillean bullfinch Loxigilla noctis on the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Starting from a large set of environmental descriptors (including metrics reflecting habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and landscape heterogeneity; as well as other variables not linked to habitat destruction, such as climatic conditions), we used PLS regression analyses to determine which variables were driving parasite prevalence on the islands. Our results showed that variables related to forest destruction were much more influential than other factors for all parasites analyzed on both islands. Remarkably, the effects documented were almost exclusively due to forest fragmentation, as opposed to habitat loss. This positive effect of forest fragmentation on blood parasite prevalence is proposed to happen through its effects on insect vectors and/or host biology. Increased understanding of the role of habitat fragmentation as a driver of parasitic diseases can help limiting the risk of emergence and proliferation of wildlife pathogenic outbreaks and zoonosis through informed landscape planning. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce population sizes and increase isolation between populations. To better understand how functional connectivity is affected by habitat modification over large scales, we here applied a meta-population framework to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly degraded and fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Other studies have used mainly hypothetical or estimated dispersal values for connectivity calculation which may not be reflective of species requirements. Here, we collated dispersal values for 45 species of birds, 5 mammals and 4 insects and found that 50% of the Atlantic Forest species can cross only up to 150 m of open gaps between forest patches. Because of the high levels of fragmentation, the median size of a functionally connected network of fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest only decreased from 15 ha to 14 ha when the crossable distance considered was reduced from 150 m to 0 m. We show that for species solely reliant on native forest habitat, a large proportion of the remaining Atlantic Forest fragments represent many small and isolated populations with few large connected areas. Our results support further evidence that for future management and restoration to be successful, existing connectivity must be vastly improved to provide forest areas large enough to support viable populations. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Worldwide, native species increasingly contend with the interacting stressors of habitat fragmentation and invasive species, yet their combined effects have rarely been examined. Direct negative effects of invasive omnivores are well documented, but the indirect effects of resource competition or those caused by predator avoidance are unknown. Here we isolated and examined the independent and interactive effects of invasive omnivorous Black rats (Rattus rattus) and forest fragment size on the interactions between avian predators and their arthropod prey. Our study examines whether invasive omnivores and ecosystem fragment size impact: 1) the vertical distribution of arthropod species composition and abundance, and 2) the vertical profile of foraging behaviors of five native and two non-native bird species found in our study system. We predicted that the reduced edge effects and greater structural complexity and canopy height of larger fragments would limit the total and proportional habitat space frequented by rats and thus limit their impact on both arthropod biomass and birds' foraging behavior. We experimentally removed invasive omnivorous Black rats across a 100-fold (0.1 to 12 ha) size gradient of forest fragments on Hawai'i Island, and paired foraging observations of forest passerines with arthropod sampling in the 16 rat-removed and 18 control fragments. Rat removal was associated with shifts in the vertical distribution of arthropod biomass, irrespective of fragment size. Bird foraging behavior mirrored this shift, and the impact of rat removal was greater for birds that primarily eat fruit and insects compared with those that consume nectar. Evidence from this model study system indicates that invasive rats indirectly alter the feeding behavior of native birds, and consequently impact multiple trophic levels. This study suggests that native species can modify their foraging behavior in response to invasive species removal and presumably arrival through behavioral plasticity. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

AB  - Motion-activated cameras captured images of 2 Keel-billed Toucans (Ramphastos sulfuratus) on and near the ground in two 900 m2 experimental forest restoration plots located in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico, during July 2015. Toucans have been known to forage widely for fruit in fragmented landscapes. Our cameras indicated that they additionally foraged on and near the ground for insects or other animal prey in relatively predator-free forest patches. As key agents of dispersal of large-seeded old-growth trees, toucans and other large frugivores were likely responsible for recruitment of animal-dispersed tree species of mature forest in our experimental plantings, even in stands of wind-dispersed trees or controls where animal-dispersed tree species were not planted. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - Forest degradation and fragmentation of quality habitat across the tropics underpins an urgent need for the conservation of area-sensitive species. Management strategies adopted for small-scale landscape patches may not be suitable for conservation of different communities across large landscapes. In this context, we examined the relationship of bird community composition and different bird functional groups with tree cover and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at multiple landscape scales and also tested the effect of forest degradation on bird community composition. This study demonstrates the importance of core forest habitat for the conservation of area sensitive species. Forest degradation had negative impact on the bird community composition though some functional groups were associated with degraded areas. At the community level, bird density and richness was best explained by a combination of both NDVI at the patch level (50 m scale) and tree cover at the landscape level (500 m scale) where the patch level character was found to be more important than landscape level character. Most of the functional groups which preferred insects as primary or secondary diet items were sensitive to differences at the patch level (NDVI), whereas large frugivorous species were sensitive to differences at the landscape level (tree cover). High vegetation complexity should be conserved at the patch level (at least up to 50 m) for the conservation of insectivorous, nectarivorous and small to medium size frugivorous groups and tree cover should be conserved at the landscape level (at least up to 500 m) for the conservation of large-bodied frugivorous birds. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - Tropical forests are on the front lines of the current global extinction crisis. Species with restricted habitat requirements and slow reproductive rates, such as the spectacular hornbills (Bucerotidae) of the Paleotropics, are particularly vulnerable. We present the first long-term quantitative population assessment of nine forest hornbill species in Ghana, part of the Upper Guinea forest biodiversity hotspot in West Africa. From 1990 to 2009, hornbill encounter rates declined with 32–88% across eight species found in the region. Seven separate surveys between 1990 and 2014 indicated declines in at least six of eight species detected, with large-bodied species hardest hit. Depleted remnant populations of large hornbills mainly persist in two large and relatively well-protected wildlife reserves, Ankasa Resource Reserve and Kakum National Park. Contrastingly, the five largest species of the nine hornbills known to Bia Biosphere Reserve, one of Ghana's few forest wildlife reserves, apparently vanished completely since the 1990s, mainly due to uncontrolled hunting. Similarly, several large hornbills have disappeared from forest reserves where hunting is widespread. We conclude that uncontrolled hunting is the major driver of the recent drastic declines and population extirpations of large hornbills, while reductions in small insectivorous species may be related to extensive fragmentation and habitat disturbances of the Ghanaian forest biome. We call for urgent conservation action to prevent further declines and impending extirpations of forest hornbills and other wildlife in West Africa. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the Neotropics as a result of agriculture, cattle ranching, and timber extraction. The effects of disturbance on the bird communities of this ecosystem have not been well studied. In this study, we evaluated changes in the richness, abundance, and diversity of birds and their diet types in the following land uses in southwestern Mexico: agroecosystem, palm grove, forest edge, and undisturbed forest. Visual and auditory sampling was performed for 1 year (August 2014 to July 2015) in 40 circular plots with a radius of 30 m (10 plots per land use). Differences in the composition and the abundance of bird species in plots of distinct land use were analyzed by a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to determine similarity among the data. In total, 101 species from 29 families were found in the study sites. The agroecosystem presented the greatest species richness (70 species), followed by undisturbed forest (57). Overall abundance of birds differed significantly among land uses. Bird abundance and dominance, in addition to the abundance of diet types, also varied significantly among land uses and between dry and rainy seasons. We found species of open habitats as well as species dependent on undisturbed forest fragments. The results suggest that seasonal variation in the abundance of birds is mainly determined by the availability of food resources and other local environmental factors. The abundance of carnivorous, granivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous, and frugivorous birds was higher at disturbed sites while the abundance of nectarivorous birds was higher in the undisturbed forest. The species composition of the undisturbed forest was most distinct among the land uses. Our results showed that the comparison of diet types was more useful for understanding the effect of land-use changes than the sole evaluation of the structural patterns of bird assemblages. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - Tropical conservation strategies traditionally focus on large tracts of pristine forests but, given rapid primary forest decline, understanding the role of secondary forest remnants for biodiversity maintenance is critical. Until now, the interactive effects of changes in forest amount, configuration and disturbance history (secondary vs. primary forest) on the conservation value of tropical landscapes have remained unknown, hampering the incorporation of these global change drivers into local and global conservation planning. We disentangled effects of landscape-wide forest amount, fragment size and forest age (old growth vs. secondary forest) on abundance, α-diversity, β-diversity (biotic homogenization) and community shifts of bird communities in human-dominated landscapes of southern Costa Rica. Utilizing two complementary methods, yielding 6,900 individual detections and 223 species, we characterized bird communities in 49 forest fragments representing independent gradients in fragment size (<5 ha vs. >30 ha) and forest amount (5%–80%) in the surrounding landscape (within 1000 m). Abundance and α-diversity of forest specialists and insectivores declined by half in small fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest. Conversely, secondary forest at the landscape scale showed no such compensation effect. Similarly, a null-model approach indicated significant biotic homogenization in small vs. large fragments, but only in landscapes with little old-growth forest, suggesting forest amount and configuration interactively affect β-diversity in tropical human-dominated landscapes. Finally, dramatic abundance-based community shifts relative to intact forests are largely a result of landscape-scale loss of old growth rather than changes in overall forest cover. Policy implications. Our study provides strong evidence that retaining old growth within tropical human-modified landscapes can simultaneously curb erosion of avian forest specialist α-diversity, mitigate collapse of β-diversity (biotic homogenization) and dampen detrimental avian community shifts. However, secondary forests play, at best, a subordinate role to mitigate these processes. To maintain tropical forest biodiversity, retaining old-growth forest within landscapes should be first priority, highlighting a land-sparing approach. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The planet earth is inhabited by diverse array of living organisms such as microorganisms, plants, animals and human beings which collectively constitute the biodiversity. Each and every element of the living component of the system has its own role, either positive or negative, to play as a system component. So preservation and conservation of living organisms, whether they are tiny or large, become immense important in playing beneficial role in maintaining biodiversity. Mega-herbivorous animal such as elephant has major impact on the terrestrial ecosystems in which they live and thus on the animals that depend on these habitats. Elephant can be referred as "keystone species" because it facilitates feeding by other herbivores that disperse seeds and supports large assemblages of invertebrates, such as dung beetles, and lower plants such as algae and fungi apart from enriching soil nutrients through dung piles. These algae and fungi are preferred nutrient plants for some reptiles such as monitor lizard and star tortoise in the semiarid tropical forests. Dung beetle accumulation attracts many insectivorous birds. Dung deposition into water holes is being benefited to the Pisces and amphibians. Seed dispersal through alimentary canal induces germination and survival capacity of the seedlings to maintain the forest heterogeneity. Elephant also does some of the silvicultural practices such as creation of paths in dense forest, maintenance of grazing lawns and height of the trees and thinning in thick vegetation cover to keep the sustainable utility of the forest. Identification of subsoil water and natural salt licks through elephants' strong sense is also shared by the other animals especially the herbivores for which intake of minerals from the natural soil is most important for many physiological activities. The pachyderm is under severe threat due to various conservation problems such as loss of habitat, habitat quality and corridors, reduction of home range, population increase, impact of developmental activities, human-elephant conflict issues and poaching for ivory. Among the factors, some of them may be responsible for major proportions, and some of them involve less proportion. But these are the reasons listed as conservation problems for the long-run conservation of Asian elephant especially in Southern India. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - Body condition (BC) is a measure of the nutritional status of an animal represented mainly by the size of its energy reserves. In birds this condition is related with the biological fitness of the individual as it has effects on its behavior, reproductive success and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the BC of passerine birds in a Tropical dry forest fragment located north of the department of Tolima, Colombia, and analyze its seasonal and interannual changes over the years 2010-2014. The BC of 37 species was evaluated using the scaled mass index, which includes morphometric data such as wing chord length, tarsus length, total length, and body mass. The species that showed statistical differences in BC belonged to trophic groups Insectivore, Insectivore-Frugivore and Granivore-Insectivore. Interannual differences (P < 0.05) were found in the BC of Cyclarhis gujanensis, Sporophila funerea, Sporophila schistacea and Volatinia jacarina, and interseasonal differences in the BC of Camptostoma obsoletum, Euscarthmus meloryphus and Stelgidopteryx ruficollis. The only species that showed significant variations in both temporal scales were Sporophila minuta and Certhiaxis cinnamomeus. We concluded that BC varies significantly in some bird species on a seasonal or interannual scale and not globally in the Passeriformes assemblage. This variation is mediated mainly by the effects of precipitation on other ecosystem variables such as food availability, which is considered responsible for the energetic contribution and the weight gain of the individuals. © 2018, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been transformed into a mosaic of forest fragments that impacts local populations of vertebrates, in particular birds. In the state of Sergipe, Brazil, while only approximately 10% of the original forest remains, ornithological research is still incipient, and basic data are still lacking. In this context, the present study investigated the bird community of a remnant of Atlantic Forest in the municipality of Japoatã using complementary methods in a rapid survey approach. The composition of the community and its trophic guilds was defined and compared with other localities in Sergipe, and Atlantic Forest sites in other Brazilian states. Data were collected in October 2016, by mist-netting and the compilation of MacKinnon lists. A total of 118 bird species were recorded during 1088 net-h and in 60 MacKinnon lists. Four of these species are under some risk of extinction, and one of these is endemic to the region. The most diverse families were Thraupidae, Tyrannidae, Trochilidae, and Thamnophilidae, with the relative contribution of each family varying according to the the sampling method used. The most common species were Manacus manacus (Linnaeus, 1766) and Coereba flaveola (Linnaeus, 1758). The omnivores were the largest guild (n = 301 individuals), followed by the insectivores (n = 236) and the frugivores n = 146). The combined survey approach proved effective, increasing the number of bird species known to occur in the study area to 165, with an increase of more than 40% in comparison with previous surveys in the same area. Overall, the results of the present study reinforce the need for further ornithological surveys in the region, and the value of combining complementary approaches for a more comprehensive inventory during rapid surveys. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

AB  - ∙ The Variegated Antpitta (Grallaria varia) is the largest member of the terrestrial insectivores guild within its Amazonian range. Despite the bird’s large size and loud vocalizations, however, basic aspects of G. varia’s natural history remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted intensive tracking of one individual in a nature reserve in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, describing - for the first time with radio telemetry - space use, movement patterns, and roosting sites of G. varia. Over the course of 50 days in July and August 2017, the tracked individual moved slowly through a home range covering ∼ 17.6 ha and was generally quiet, singing at only two of 68 locations that together comprised its home range. Of five roosting sites, four included visual observations where the bird slept 3–7 (mean 4.5) m aboveground in relatively open mid-story trees. We found no evidence of commutes to regular roost sites as all nocturnal locations were located close (mean 59.6 m, range 24–101 m) to the most recent diurnal locations. Slow movements on the ground without commutes to foraging or roosting sites help explain low capture rates in mist nets for this species. Our telemetry data suggest that G. varia home range may be larger than previously estimated in studies that relied heavily on bird vocalizations to determine area needs, though such methods may yield adequate results at times when birds vocalize frequently. Regardless, large area requirements help to explain the disappearance of G. varia documented in tropical forest fragments. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome is one of the most biodiverse, and threatened in the world. Most studies on bird parasitism by ticks in Brazil have been carried out in forest fragments of this biome, and primarily focused on pathogens the ticks carry than the relationships between ticks and birds. Accordingly, in this study we conducted a quantitative analysis, by means of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), on the published data about parasitism by Amblyomma ticks on birds of the Atlantic Forest. The hypothesis tested was that ecological and morphological variables of the host (habitat occupation, eating habits, site of occurrence, mass and length) are associated with parasitism by ticks. Based on 403 tick/bird associations we found that the most prevalent species associated with Atlantic Forest birds are Amblyomma longirostre, Amblyomma nodosum, Amblyomma calcaratum, Amblyomma aureolatum and Amblyomma parkeri. All these species showed association with birds inhabiting the forest understory and midstory. In addition, both immature stages of A. aureolatum and nymphs of A. calcaratum were associated with birds with terrestrial habits. Regarding diets, the most common association was with insectivorous birds, followed by frugivorous and nectarivorous birds. All tick species were associated with forest border birds, while A. aureolatum was also associated with birds which forage in open areas. As for bird length and mass, those with up to 40 cm and 40 g are the most associated with tick larvae and nymphs. In terms of hosts, the Thraupidae, Thamnophilidae and Furnariidae families were the most parasitized. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Land conversion represents a serious threat to terrestrial biodiversity and effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes requires an understanding of the relationship between spatial heterogeneity and biodiversity. Coffee is the most valuable tropical export in the world with the capacity to affect biodiversity on a large scale, and much of the world's coffee is grown in open plantations (sun coffee), where little research has documented how landscape structure or food availability affect bird diversity. We examined the effects of both landscape characteristics and foliage arthropod abundance on bird species richness, total bird abundance and the abundance of foraging guilds in sun coffee plantations of central Kenyan highlands. Variation in the local landscape appeared to have little effect on bird abundance, while the foliage arthropod community, particularly number of arthropod orders, may have a strong impact on omnivore and insectivore abundance in sun coffee. These results do not mean small scale fragments or landscape composition is unimportant to bird communities in our region for several reasons, including the high model uncertainty that may indicate an important missing variable, the habitat complexity and presence of large forest reserves around our study sites, and the single scale at which our variables were tested. Our results indicate that farm managers wanting to increase bird abundance, especially omnivores and insectivores, should consider balancing the need to eradicate coffee pests and leaving an intact arthropod community that likely increases these guilds. Further study is needed to validate these patterns, which may have strong implications for bird biodiversity in agricultural settings across other areas in eastern Africa. © 2018

AB  - Remnant forest fragments provide an opportunity for conservation in fragmented landscapes but some patches are more useful than others. Forest fragments around Budongo Forest Reserve, an Important Bird Area in western Uganda, were surveyed to explore the effects of different aspects of habitat fragmentation on bird guild composition. We recorded 1 128 individuals of 75 bird species over 7 056 net hours. The greatest number of birds and species were recorded in the forest fragments that were large, near to the continuous forest and surrounded by subsistence farmland. However, rarefied species richness was not affected by distance, size or matrix type; instead, forest specialist species were replaced by generalists and visitors with increasing fragmentation. The proportion of forest specialists and of terrestrial insectivores decreased with distance from the main forest, canopy openness and matrix intensity but not with fragment area. The findings show that bird assemblages vary in their response to habitat fragmentation but within guilds the response to fragmentation can be consistent, and can make ecological sense. Forest bird conservation can therefore benefit from information on species ecology when deciding which bird species and which parts of the landscape are to be prioritised for conservation or monitoring purposes. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Here we present a brief review on how the loss of fauna can cause a concomitant loss in plant diversity in the state of Espírito Santo, focusing on the context of current habitat loss and fragmentation and the importance of the mutualistic interactions between animals and plants. We discuss the main groups of fauna that are involved in pollination and seed dispersal, especially those that are found in the state of Espírito Santo. These ecological processes were selected due to their relevance for population dynamics and population genetics of plants. In Atlantic Forest, important pollinators include a variety of insects (especially bees), along with many species of birds and bats. Seed dispersers also include many taxonomic groups, from ants to large mammals. Each of these groups contribute in their own unique and complementary, rather than redundant, way. Habitat fragmentation causes a variety of problems for habitat integrity and the reduction of species diversity, and smaller fragments tend to support fewer species and smaller populations. As a consequence, pollinators and seed dispersers are lost or their activity is reduced, thereby reducing even further the reproductive success of the plants, leading to a vicious cycle of reduction of species diversity.

AB  - South America is undergoing a rapid and large-scale conversion of natural habitats to cultivated land. Ecosystem services still remain important but their level and sustainability are not known. We quantified predation intensity in an Argentinian agricultural landscape containing remnants of the original chaco serrano forest using artificial sentinel prey. We sought to identify the main predators and the effect of landscape configuration and maize phenology on predation pressure by invertebrate and vertebrate predators in this landscape. The most common predators were chewing insects (50.4% predation events), birds (22.7%), and ants (17.5%). Overall predation rates in forest fragments (41.6% per day) were significantly higher than in the surrounding maize fields (21.5% per day). Invertebrate predation was higher inside and at the edge of forest fragments than within fields, and did not change with increasing distance from a fragment edge, indicating a lack of spillover from the native habitat remnants to the cultivated matrix at the local scale. Distance from a continuous forest had a positive impact on predation by invertebrates and a negative impact on vertebrate predation. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Birds can be used as bioindicators to evaluate the quality of a habitat. The objective of this study was to record richness and abundance of bird communities in two semi-deciduous forest fragments in Brazil (Olavo Egydio Setubal-OES; and Igurê-IGR). A subsequent analysis and comparison of the avifauna structure in each of the fragments were made including previous studies in the same areas. Point counts methodology was chosen for each fragment along 12 months. The results showed the occurrence of a total of 129 bird species for both areas. Although we registered 102 species for each site, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index, respectively, were slightly higher in OES (H' = 3.93; J' = 0.85) than in IGR (H' = 3.87; J' = 0.83). Among birds with various feeding habits, the highest percentage was recorded for understory insectivores in both areas. However, higher percentage of canopy frugivores was found in OES and higher percentage of canopy and understory nectarivores and canopy carnivores was registered in IGR. Moreover, in IGR higher abundance of omnivores was registered than in OES. On the other hand, in OES more specialist species were found while in IGR the percentage of generalist species was higher. Variations in diversity and evenness compared with three previous studies in the same areas showed higher values in the current study. Interestingly, the proportions of understory insectivores were maintained for both areas, however, in IGR higher percentage of omnivores and in OES more specialists than canopy frugivores and understory insectivores, respectively, were reported. Thus, in OES the specificity of feeding habits was maintained, but in IGR the percentage of generalists increased. This might be associated with the response to the edge effect which occurs in IGR's fragment, in particular due to the relation of shape versus size, which would determine its low perimeter. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The transformation of ecosystems through human activities can affect the biological and ecological processes of bird species, and can even lead to groups of species becoming isolated due to deforestation, causing a decrease in genetic diversity and the extirpation of species. To evaluate the composition and structure of bird communities associated with the tropical dry forest ecosystem in the Guarinocito jurisdiction (La Victoria, Caldas) we identified two landscape units: a forest area (dry forest matrix) and an interfered area (matrix of lands), presenting human intervention such as roads and grassland systems. Point counts of 10 min long were carried out in each unit to survey birds between 06:00 and 09:00 hours and between 16:00 and 18:00 hours. Mist nets were set up to complete the species record. Three four-day long sampling trips were carried out in April 2013, November 2013, and October 2014 to consider the seasonal variability that affects the environmental conditions in the study area. The sampling representativeness was evaluated using non-parametric estimates. All observed or captured individuals were assigned to a trophic guild in order to evaluate the community structure in the two established landscape units. A total of 1,005 individuals from 36 families and 127 species were recorded. The most abundant species were Thraupis episcopus (7.36%) and Sicalis flaveola (6.77%). Sample representativeness ranged from 68.18% (Jack 2) to 86.03% (Bootstrap). Although no significant differences between the two landscape units were detected (THutchinson=1.59, p=0.81), species diversity was higher in the forested area than in the intervened area. The dominant trophic guild in both landscape units was that of insectivorous birds. No significant differences in bird community trophic structure were found between the two landscape units (Χ2=14.60, p=0.33). The size, shape, or intervention history of the fragments could have resulted in a lack of differences in the structure and composition of the avifauna in the two landscape units.

AB  - Body condition is a qualitative evaluation of an animal and is directly related to its fitness, with the relative mass index (RMI) as a tool for indirect estimation of energy reserves. This study evaluated if the body condition of birds differs between guilds, if it is reflected in levels of subcutaneous fat, and if it is influenced by the weather season and ectoparasite presence. The RMI was calculated for Antilophia galeata (frugivorous), Arremon flavirostris, Eucometis penicillata (omnivorous), Basileuterus culicivorus, and Myiothlypis leucophrys (insectivorous). It varied among guilds (F2, 295= 187.92; P &lt; 0.05), with insectivorous species having negative values. The RMI varied between the wet and dry seasons only for A. galeata (F1, 1 = 7.28; P &lt; 0.05) but remained positive throughout the year in omnivorous species. The RMI did not vary with the presence/absence of ectoparasites nor among the different levels of subcutaneous fat, which were predominantly low. The negative RMI of insectivores and its variation in frugivorous between seasons suggest that the body condition is influenced by the type of diet and the availability of food resources, indicating that birds with a specialized diet may be more sensitive to environmental variations that result in fluctuations in the food supply. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

AB  - Secondary forests have reclaimed one sixth of deforested land worldwide, and much of this revegetated forest lies in agricultural and increasingly semi-urban landscapes. While, many studies have described faunal populations such as birds across forest-agricultural landscapes, they generally note minor changes in total species richness and more significant changes in species composition. Few studies, however, consider faunal diversity among secondary forests of different management history, such as manual restoration or natural revegetation. In this study, we surveyed bird communities in three forest sites of varying restoration and natural revegetation treatments in a tropical urban-agricultural landscape in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our sites include manually restored and naturally revegetating forest of 20-40 years since clearing. We found that a diverse assemblage of birds visit and occupy forest fragments within the urban- agricultural landscape, including two IUCN-listed near-threatened species. Bird species richness was similar across sites of different management history; species composition varied only slightly, but differences existed in presence and occupancy for forest-dependent groups, such as large frugivores and forest insectivores. In the manually restored site, bird diversity may have been limited by under-developed forest structure, but we were unable to isolate the effects of patch size and landscape matrix. We suggest that future restoration activities consider forest structure in addition to plant species diversity when attempting to restore faunal populations, and that future studies take heed of landscape and matrix parameters when evaluating restoration projects. © 2017 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Rubber is one of the most rapidly expanding monocultures in the tropics, and has precipitated biodiversity and ecosystem function loss. Identifying measures to improve biodiversity outcomes in rubber-forest mosaics is critical for tropical fauna. We evaluated how avian diversity responded to plantation- and landscape-level environmental variables. The most parsimonious model at the plot scale contained inter-tree planting distance for rubber, plantation age, and inverse distance weight of forest as predictors. The most supported model at the landscape scale contained both distance to forest patches larger than 100 ha and natural forest area as predictors. Model predictions indicated that natural forest area had the largest contribution to bird richness at landscape levels; avian diversity was projected to more than double when natural forest area increased from 25% to 75%. Frugivores and insectivores exhibited the strongest response to gains in natural forest area. Our results indicated that plantation smallholders could achieve biodiversity gains by retaining older trees and planting rubber trees with larger gaps, but that the most critical intervention is retaining large natural forest patches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human activities often cause habitat fragmentation and how forest fragments affect species range distributions has implications for ecology and conservation. However, few studies have considered communities within the same landscape. Here, we analyzed metacommunity structure to determine the range distributions for species in four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, social wasps, and trees) in a patchy landscape of semi-deciduous Atlantic forest in southwestern Brazil. Although trees are a key component of the environment for animals in forested patches, the ranges of bird, wasp, and amphibian species did not change in concert with the species ranges of trees. The species ranges of amphibians and social wasps were unaffected by fragmentation gradients and exhibited independent distribution patterns (i.e., random structure). In contrast, birds and trees exhibited range turnover along different fragmentation gradients, indicating that species show idiosyncratic responses to abiotic factors (i.e., Gleasonian structure). For birds, some less-resilient species occurred only in fragments with a large area of native vegetation at a radius of 5 km from the center of the sampled forest fragments, whereas other more stress-tolerant species occurred only in sites with small areas of native vegetation. For trees, some later succession species (e.g., animal-dispersed seeds) occurred only in fragments with high connectivity, whereas earlier-recruiting species (e.g., wind-dispersed seeds) occurred in fragments with low connectivity. Thus, determining the effects of human-modified landscapes on species range distributions, even within the same landscape, might not be a trivial task. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest is extremely biodiverse but is threatened by anthropogenic land-use change. In South Africa, remnant forest patches are divided into highly restricted but protected indigenous forest (IF) and abundant but unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush (DB), which likely represents secondary/regenerating IF. We tested the hypothesis that DB had value for conserving forest-dependent avian taxonomic and functional diversity, as (a) DB is situated with in the forest-anthropogenic land-use mosaic and (b) birds maintain diverse ecosystem functions and are sensitive to environmental change given their varied biological traits. We conducted 149 and 112 fixed-radius point-count surveys of avian communities in 99, and 24, patches of DB and IF, respectively, at each location recording microhabitat vegetation structure. We compared vegetation characteristics and taxonomic species richness between vegetation classes, and tested the breadth of functional trait-space and for significant associations with vegetation structures at each survey location, using RLQ analysis. Vegetation classes differed significantly, but floral species overlap and vegetation structures in DB closely resembled regenerating IF habitat. Specialist ground-nesting and insect-gleaning species corresponded to taller, more diverse IF structures. Other biological traits and total species richness overlapped broadly across both classes, but IF had significantly higher mean species richness. Given the relatively high taxonomic and functional diversity of the avian community in the abundant DB, the scarcity of IF, and the proximity of DB to the anthropogenic land-use mosaic, we recommend allocating suitable DB patches to the Protected Area Network, which may simultaneously help preserve avian taxonomic and functional diversity, facilitate colonisation throughout the fragmented landscape and provide ecosystem services to anthropogenic land uses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - South African coastal forests form part of two critically endangered eco-regions and harbor an extinction debt. Remaining fragments are small, isolated, and embedded within a range of human land-use types. In this study, we ask: how should we invest conservation resources if we want to restore this landscape and prevent predicted extinctions? To answer this question, we use path analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects of forest area, forest connectivity, and matrix land-use types on species richness within five bird feeding guilds. We found that forest connectivity had a significant direct effect on insectivores—fragments that were more connected had more species of insectivores than those that were isolated. Moreover, forest area had a significant indirect effect on insectivores that was mediated through tree species richness. Larger fragments had more species of trees, which led to more species of insectivores. Fragment area, connectivity, matrix land-use type, and tree species richness had no significant effects on the species richness of frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, or generalist feeders. To conserve insectivores in coastal forests, conservation efforts should focus on maximizing fragment connectivity across the landscape, but also protect the tree community within fragments from degradation. This can be achieved by including matrix habitats that adjoin forest fragments within forest conservation and restoration plans. Natural matrix habitats can increase connectivity, provide supplementary resources, buffer fragments from degradation, and could play an important role in safeguarding diversity and preventing extinctions in this threatened human-modified landscape. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Wooded biomes converted to human-modified landscapes (HML) are common throughout the tropics, yielding small and isolated forest patches surrounded by an agricultural matrix. Diverse anthropogenic interventions in HMLs influence patches in complex ways, altering natural dynamics. Assessing current condition or ecological integrity in these patches is a challenging task for ecologists. Taking the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a case study, we used the conceptual framework of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), a multimetric approach, to assess the ecological integrity of eight small forest patches in a highly disturbed HML with different configurations and histories. The IBI was developed using bird assemblages found in these patches, and its performance was compared with analytical approaches commonly used in environmental assessment, such as general richness and Shannon's diversity index. As a first step, the IBI procedure identifies an existing gradient of human disturbance in the study region and checks which biotic characteristics (candidate metrics) vary systematically across the gradient. A metric is considered valid when its’ relationship with the gradient provides an ecological interpretation of the environment. Then, the final IBI is elaborated using each valid metric, obtaining a score for each site. Over one year of sampling, 168 bird species were observed, providing 74 different bird candidate metrics to be tested against the disturbance gradient. Seven of them were considered valid:richness of threatened species; richness of species that use both “forest and non-forest” habitats; abundance of endemics, abundance of small understory-midstory insectivores, abundance of exclusively forest species; abundance of non-forest species, and abundance of species that forage exclusively in the midstory stratum. Each metric provided complementary information about the patch's ecological integrity. The resulting IBI showed a significant linear relationship with the gradient of human disturbance, while total species richness and Shannońs diversity index did not. Application of numerical approaches, such as total species richness and Shannon's diversity, did not distinguish ecological traits among species. The IBI proved better for assessing and interpreting ecological and environmental condition of small patches in highly disturbed HML. The IBI framework, its multimetric character, and the ease with which it can be adapted to diverse situations, make it an effective approach for assessing environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest region, and also for many other small forest patches in the tropics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Context: Conservation research often focuses on individual threats at a single spatial scale, but population declines can result from multiple stressors occurring at different spatial scales. Analyses incorporating alternative hypotheses across spatial scales allow more robust evaluation of the ecological processes underlying population declines. Objectives: Populations of many aerially insectivorous birds are declining, yet conservation efforts remain focused on habitat due to an absence of data on changes in prey availability. We evaluate the potential for prey and habitat availability at multiple spatial scales to influence a population of eastern whip-poor-wills (Antrostomus vociferous). Methods: We assess relationships between landcover (topographical map and satellite imagery) and insect abundance (moths and beetles from blacklight traps), and whip-poor-will distribution and abundance within eastern Canada using Ontario breeding bird atlas data (1980s and 2000s), acoustic recordings (regional), and point counts (local). Results: Whip-poor-will occurrence in both atlas time periods was positively associated with forest area and fragmentation, but only a delayed effect of urban area explained reductions in detection. Contemporary regional whip-poor-will presence was positively related to moth abundance, and local whip-poor-will abundance was best predicted by area of open-canopy forest, anthropogenic linear disturbance density, and beetle abundance. Our finding that bird presence and abundance were associated with human activity and insect abundance across spatial scales suggests factors beyond habitat structure are likely driving population declines in whip-poor-wills and other aerial insectivores. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of examining multiple hypotheses, including seasonally and locally variable food availability, across a range of spatial scales to direct conservation efforts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The effects of fragmented landscapes on tropical bird movements remain poorly understood, partly due to a dearth of experimental tests of gap crossing behavior. To learn more about the factors involved in gap crossing behavior, we used predator-playback experiments on four species of understory-insectivore birds (Chestnut-backed Antbird Poliocrania exsul, Black-crowned Antshrike Thamnophilus atrinucha, White-breasted Wood-wren Henicorhina leucosticta, Stripe-breasted Wren Cantorchilus thoracicus) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We sought to understand species- and family-level differences in gap crossing behavior, specifically: (1) the effect of forest-opening (gap) width, and (2) the effect of perceived risk of predation. A total of 39 treatment (predator playback) and 39 control (silent playback) trials were conducted at gap sites ranging in width from 2.8 to 12.6 m. Predator playback decreased the number of times that birds crossed study gaps, increased latency time in all but one species, and increased the closest distance that birds approached the playback speaker. Gap width affected only latency time: as gap width increased, latency time increased. We observed strong differences in behavioral response between families and species of different foraging heights. In the statistical models, family (Thamnophilidae and Troglodytidae), foraging height (low or mid-story), and trial type (silent control or predator treatment) consistently emerged as strongest predictors of bird behavior. Our results indicate that small linear gaps (< 12.6 m) do not impede movement for these four focal species, but that risk of predation May hinder bird movement even at small gaps. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a rapidly expanding crop in the Amazonian region of Brazil. Brazilian law requires all landowners, including oil palm plantations, to maintain forest reserves and forested riparian corridors as a way to limit biodiversity losses. Because of these laws and the forest-like structure of oil palm, these plantations may function as habitat for some native species in the region. We tested this assumption by experimentally translocating Cinereous Antshrikes (Thamnomanes caesius), a forest understory insectivorous bird and nuclear member of mixed-species flocks, from forest reserves to riparian corridors within a large oil palm plantation landscape and tracked their movements back to their home ranges. In total, we recorded the movements of 18 individuals, 8 of which were translocated. The other 10 individuals were tracked within their home ranges in the forest reserves. Six of the eight translocated birds successfully returned to their forest home range, but only one bird flew through the more direct route back through the oil palm matrix while the rest took longer routes through adjoining riparian corridors. Homing time for translocated birds averaged 9.57 (±2.23 SE) days. The home range of birds within the forest reserves averaged 2.39 (±0.69 SE) ha, and, with the exception of the single returning bird, Cinereous Antshrikes were never detected in oil palm. Our results suggest that oil palm plantations are a barrier to movements of our study species, and that riparian corridors connecting forest fragments may be effective routes for dispersal. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, were sampled across the Great Lakes basin in 2010 through 2015 to provide a system-wide assessment of current exposure to organic contaminants. The results provide information identified as critical by regulators to assess the “bird or animal deformity or reproductive problems” beneficial use impairment. Eggs were collected from 69 sites across all 5 Great Lakes, including 27 Areas of Concern (AOCs), some with multiple sites, and 10 sites not listed as an AOC. Concentrations of organic contaminants in eggs were quantified and compared with background and reproductive effect thresholds. Approximately 30% of AOCs had geometric mean concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at or below average background exposure (0.34 μg/g wet wt). Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was minimal, and only 3 of 27 AOCs and 1 non-AOC had geometric mean concentrations that exceeded background for tree swallows (96 ng/g wet wt). Concentrations of both PCBs and PBDEs were 10 to 20 times below the lower limit associated with impaired hatching success. In contrast, geometric mean concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furan (PCDD-F) toxic equivalents (TEQs) at the Saginaw River and Bay AOC and Midland, Michigan, USA (a non-AOC site), exceeded the lower limit for hatching effects (181 pg/g PCDD-F TEQs). The rest of the sites had geometric mean concentrations of PCDD-F TEQs below background levels (87 pg/g PCDD-F TEQs). Other organic contaminants, including p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, mirex, heptachlor, and chlordane, were at or below background or adverse effect concentrations.

AB  - Despite being an important area for endemic species of birds, the Caatinga biome is highly fragmented due to anthropogenic influences and there is a lack of study on many aspects of its birds’ biology. In this semiarid environment, rainfall is highly seasonal, with two different and well-defined periods: a long dry season, and a short rainy season. This study aimed to qualify and quantify the diet of Sakesphorus cristatus, an endemic thamnophilid bird of the Caatinga, as well as to determine whether there was temporal variation between two different seasons and between dry seasons of two consecutive years. Surprisingly, this was the first study to have focused on describing and quantifying items found of any bird species’ diet in the Caatinga. We analyzed the stomach contents of 72 specimens collected in the municipality of São Felix do Coribe, Bahia, Brazil. Data analysis included relative abundance and occurrence, average consumption/sample and alimentary importance index of each food category. Sampling adequacy was assessed using cumulative curves constructed with diversity index and coefficient of variation. In general there is a high predominance of ants and termites, with seasonal shifts in the proportion of each item, and a high contribution of caterpillars during the breeding season. During the dry season, the most predominant prey categories in the diet were Formicidae, Isoptera and Coleoptera (adult, A), while during the rainy season, there was an increase in the proportion of Isoptera, Coleoptera (A) and Lepidoptera (larvae) consumption and a decrease in Formicidae. There was no significant difference between consumption of prey items between the two dry seasons. The overall analysis suggests that S. cristatus feeds mainly on the aforementioned insects and is an opportunistic species, adjusting its diet according to their prey availability. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

AB  - We analyzed data from a woodland site for a 59-year period to determine whether changes in bird populations are related to changes in the diversity and relative abundance of woody plant species even when vegetation structure, degree of forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape, and regional changes in bird populations are taken into account. Principal component analyses generated vegetation factors encompassing variables such as total basal area, shrub density, basal area of common tree species, and measures of tree and shrub species diversity. We also calculated a forest edge/forest area index based on GIS analysis of the landscape within 2 km of the study site. Poisson regression models revealed relationships between these covariates and population changes for 19 bird species and for seven groups of species characterized by similar migration strategies or habitat requirements. All groups of habitat specialists showed a positive relationship with the first vegetation factor, which indicates that they declined as total basal area and dominance of oaks and maples increased and as tree and shrub diversity decreased. This suggests that floristic diversity may be important for determining habitat quality. Bird species associated with the shrub layer and with hemlock stands showed positive relationships with the second vegetation factor, suggesting that the recent decline in eastern hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) because of hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) had an adverse impact on these species. Forest migrants, shrub-layer specialists, long-distance migrants and permanent residents showed negative relationships with the forest edge/forest interior index, indicating that conservation efforts to protect bird communities should take the wider landscape into account. The strongest relationship for most species and species groups was with the first vegetation factor, which suggests that species composition and diversity of trees and shrubs may be especially important in determining abundance of many forest bird species.

AB  - Forest loss threatens biodiversity, but its potential effects on multitrophic ecological interactions are poorly understood. Insect herbivory depends on complex bottom-up (e.g., resource availability and plant antiherbivore defenses) and top-down forces (e.g., abundance of predators and herbivorous), but its determinants in human-altered tropical landscapes are largely unknown. Using structural equation models, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of forest loss on insect herbivory in 40 landscapes (115 ha each) from two regions with contrasting land-use change trajectories in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. We considered landscape forest cover as an exogenous predictor and (1) forest structure, (2) abundance of predators (birds and arthropods), and (3) abundance of herbivorous arthropods as endogenous predictors of insect leaf damage. From 12 predicted pathways, 11 were significant and showed that (1) leaf damage increases with forest loss (direct effect); (2) leaf damage increases with forest loss through the simplification of vegetation structure and its associated dominance of herbivorous insects (indirect effect); and further demonstrate (3) a lack of top-down control of herbivores by predators (birds and arthropods). We conclude that forest loss favors insect herbivory by undermining the bottom-up control (presumably reduced plant antiherbivore defense mechanisms) in forests dominated by fast-growing pioneer plant species, and by improving the conditions required for herbivores proliferation. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Insect herbivory has been observed to be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, although the mechanisms by which these anthropogenic disturbances affect this process are not well understood. To aid in clarifying this issue, we assessed the relation between forest cover and leaf damage caused by herbivorous insects on a representative tropical forest understory plant family, the Rubiaceae. We measured leaf area loss of Rubiaceae plants in 20 forest sites located in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and also tested whether variation in forest cover, abundance of insectivorous birds (predators) and of Rubiaceae plants (resources) could explain the observed variation in leaf damage. Herbivory levels varied between 2.6 and 12.5 percent leaf area lost and increased with decreasing forest cover, whereas the other explanatory variables did not provide additional explanatory power. Therefore, forest loss appears to be the main driver of changes in local herbivory, and ecological processes such as top-down and bottom-up control may not account for the deforestation-related increase in herbivory levels. Other mechanisms, for example leaf quality and/or the influence of the adjoining land uses, have to be explored in future studies. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - In the current scenario of human transformation of natural landscapes, fragmentation and habitat loss is considered one of the major threats to biodiversity. The characteristics of altered landscapes and remaining habitat patches influence the persistence of species and, as a direct consequence, the functioning of ecological processes. The main focus of studies at landscape scale is to understand how human modifications in natural areas lead to changes in abundance and richness of species. However, such approaches do not directly describe the functional composition of communities, nor do they describe the functional responses to fragmentation and habitat loss. Birds are an interesting taxonomic group to explore this theme, since they present important, broadly-described ecological functions for human modified habitats (e.g., seed dispersal, pollination, and insect pest control). Thus, we aimed to explore the functional responses of birds to landscape characteristics. We selected 14 human modified landscapes of Atlantic forest, found within a radius of 30 km of Alfenas, Brazil. Each landscape was characterized by metrics describing landscape configuration and composition, such as forest percentage and mean connectivity. Birds were sampled in the central patches of the landscapes and classified into 15 functional groups, based on species' traits. We constructed Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to identify the best models that explained the abundance and richness of species in each functional group. Few groups had high functional redundancy, showing the fragility of the majority of functional groups in the current modified landscapes. Forest dependent functional groups were favored by connected landscapes, higher percentage of forest cover, and high percentages of coffee matrix. On the other hand, forest independent groups were favored by irregular habitat areas and negatively impacted by forest cover and sugar cane matrices. Consistent management of altered landscapes, based on functional responses, can assist the recovery and maintenance of natural areas. We highlight the complexity involved in landscape management, considering it requires simultaneous work on composition and configuration.

AB  - Forest fragmentation and degradation leads to formation of modified habitats whose ability to support existing avifaunal diversity is still largely unknown. Bird diversity in indigenous forest, disturbed forest, plantation forest and farmlands adjacent to North Nandi Forest reserve was studied between January 2015 and June 2015. The distribution of bird feeding guilds in these habitat patches was also evaluated. Birds were surveyed using point counts, timed species counts and line transects and classified into six feeding guilds. A total of 3,232 individual birds of 151 species were recorded in the four habitats. Significant difference on bird abundance across the four habitats (F = 15.141, P ≤ 0.05, df = 3, 1121) was noted. Shannon–Weiner diversity index H′ for bird community ranged from 3.06 for plantation forest to 4.05 for disturbed forest showing a relatively diverse bird community. Insectivores (F = 3.090, P ≤ 0.05, df = 3, 297) dominated the foraging species assemblage in all the habitats significantly. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong linear relationship on bird species richness and abundance with vegetation variables (P < 0.01 in all cases). The results indicate that disturbed forest and indigenous forest support high bird species richness than plantation forest and farmlands. However, high bird abundance was observed in farmlands and plantation forest as opposed to indigenous forest and disturbed forest as they provide dispersal routes over a short distance and are important for creating corridors between primary forests. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - A major conservation challenge in mosaic landscapes is to understand how trait-specific responses to habitat edges affect bird communities, including potential cascading effects on bird functions providing ecosystem services to forests, such as pest control. Here, we examined how bird species richness, abundance and community composition varied from interior forest habitats and their edges into adjacent open habitats, within a multi-regional sampling scheme. We further analyzed variations in Conservation Value Index (CVI), Community Specialization Index (CSI) and functional traits across the forest-edge-open habitat gradient. Bird species richness, total abundance and CVI were significantly higher at forest edges while CSI peaked at interior open habitats, i.e., furthest from forest edge. In addition, there were important variations in trait- and species-specific responses to forest edges among bird communities. Positive responses to forest edges were found for several forest bird species with unfavorable conservation status. These species were in general insectivores, understorey gleaners, cavity nesters and long-distance migrants, all traits that displayed higher abundance at forest edges than in forest interiors or adjacent open habitats. Furthermore, consistently with predictions, negative edge effects were recorded in some forest specialist birds and in most open-habitat birds, showing increasing densities from edges to interior habitats. We thus suggest that increasing landscape-scale habitat complexity would be beneficial to declining species living in mosaic landscapes combining small woodlands and open habitats. Edge effects between forests and adjacent open habitats may also favor bird functional guilds providing valuable ecosystem services to forests in longstanding fragmented landscapes. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Large floral displays favour pollinator attraction and the import and export of pollen. However, large floral displays also have negative effects, such as increased geitonogamy, pollen discounting and nectar/pollen robber attraction. The size of the floral display can be measured at different scales (e.g. the flower, inflorescence or entire plant) and variations in one of these scales may affect the behaviour of flower visitors in different ways. Moreover, the fragmentation of natural forests may affect flower visitation rates and flower visitor behaviour. In the present study, video recordings of the inflorescences of a tree species (Tabebuia aurea) from the tropical savannah of central Brazil were used to examine the effect of floral display size at the inflorescence and tree scales on the visitation rate of pollinators and nectar robbers to the inflorescence, the number of flowers approached per visit, the number of visits per flower of potential pollinators and nectar robbers, and the interaction of these variables with the degree of landscape disturbance. Nectar production was quantified with respect to flower age. Although large bees are responsible for most of the pollination, a great diversity of flower insects visit the inflorescences of T. aurea. Other bee and hummingbird species are highly active nectar robbers. Increases in inflorescence size increase the visitation rate of pollinators to inflorescences, whereas increases in the number of inflorescences on the tree decrease visitation rates to inflorescences and flowers. This effect has been strongly correlated with urban environments in which trees with the largest floral displays are observed. Pollinating bees (and nectar robbers) visit few flowers per inflorescence and concentrate visits to a fraction of available flowers, generating an overdispersed distribution of the number of visits per inflorescence and per flower. This behaviour reflects preferential visits to young flowers (including flower buds) with a greater nectar supply. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London

AB  - Re-establishing connectivity between protected areas isolated by habitat clearing is a key conservation goal in the humid tropics. In northeastern Costa Rica, payments for environmental services (PES) and a government ban on deforestation have subsidized forest protection and reforestation in the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLSBC), resulting in a decline in mature forest loss and the expansion of tree plantations. We use field studies and graph models to assess how conservation efforts have altered functional connectivity over the last 25 years for four species of insectivorous understory birds. Field playback studies assessed how reforestation habitat quality affected the willingness of Myrmeciza exsul, Henicorhina leucosticta, Thamnophilus atrinucha, and Glyphorynchus spirurus to travel outside forest habitat for territorial defense. Observed travel distances were greatest in nonnative and native tree plantations with high understory stem density, regardless of overstory composition. In contrast, tree plantations with low stem density had travel responses comparable to open pasture for three of the four bird species. We modeled landscape connectivity for each species using graph models based on varying possible travel distances in tree plantations, gallery forests, and pastures. From 1986 to 2011, connectivity for all species declined in the SJLSBC landscape (5825 km2) by 14% to 21% despite only a 4.9% net loss in forest area and the rapid expansion of tree plantations over 2% of the landscape. Plantation placement in the landscape limited their potential facilitation of connectivity because they were located either far from forest cover or within already contiguous forest areas. We mapped current connectivity bottlenecks and identified priority areas for future reforestation. We estimate that reforestation of priority areas could improve connectivity by 2% with only a 1% gain in forest cover, an impressive gain given the small area reforested. Results indicate key locations where spatial targeting of PES within the SJLSBC study region would protect existing forest connectivity and enhance the connectivity benefits of reforestation. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Regenerated forests now compose over half of the world's tropical forest cover and are increasingly important as providers of ecosystem services, freshwater, and biodiversity conservation. Much of the value and functionality of regenerating forests depends on the plant diversity they contain. Tropical forest diversity is strongly shaped by mutualistic interactions between plants and fruit-eating animals (frugivores) that disperse seeds. Here we show how seed dispersal by birds can influence the speed and diversity of early successional forests in Puerto Rico. For two years, we monitored the monthly fruit production of bird-dispersed plants on a fragmented landscape, and measured seed dispersal activity of birds and plant establishment in experimental plots located in deforested areas. Two predominantly omnivorous bird species, the Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) and the Gray Kingbird (Tyrannus dominicensis), proved critical for speeding up the establishment of woody plants and increasing the species richness and diversity of the seed rain in deforested areas. Seed dispersal by these generalists increased the odds for rare plant species to disperse and establish in experimental forest-regeneration plots. Results indicate that birds that mix fruit and insects in their diets and actively forage across open and forested habitats can play keystone roles in the regeneration of mutualistic plant-animal communities. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that rare-biased (antiapostatic) frugivory and seed dispersal is the mechanism responsible for increasing plant diversity in the early-regenerating community. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Mega-hydroelectric dams in lowland Amazonia create large archipelagos of upland forest, yet few studies have taken advantage of these fragmented landscapes to examine the effects of habitat insularization on vertebrate populations. We investigated the effects of insularization on bird species richness and composition at 27 variable-sized islands formed by the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon after 25 years of isolation, which were compared to three mainland sites in adjacent continuous forest. Islands were characterized by patch and landscape metrics, and the local avifauna was surveyed at all sites (including 172 sampling points) four times using point counts, and twice using playbacks. Island size was the strongest predictor of species richness and similarity, whereas other metrics showed weak or no effect. On the basis of 61 forest bird species distributed across six foraging guilds, terrestrial omnivores and insectivores, small understorey frugivores and large-bodied trunk frugivore/faunivore comprised the guilds most affected by habitat insularization. Our results demonstrate a striking decline in avifaunal species richness, particularly in islands smaller than 55 ha, which represent ~. 90% of the ~. 3500 islands in the Balbina reservoir. We conclude that other major hydropower reservoirs across the lowland Amazonian basin are likely to experience similarly high avian extinction rates and suggest that the environmental licencing of these impoundments should be reassessed or at least include protected area offsets. © 2016.

AB  - The avifauna of Chile is relatively depauperate, comprising 469 extant species, of which 213 are terrestrial. However, the Coquimbo Region presents a broad ecological transition from the hyperarid Atacama Desert to the north, and the more mesic Chilean Mediterranean region of central Chile, resulting in relatively high species diversity. Approximately 130 species are found here, 8 of which are endemic to Chile although not to this region. Bosque Fray Jorge National Park is a 9959 ha Biosphere Reserve dominated by matorral habitat and hosting up to 123 bird species. Through avian surveys and banding over nearly a decade we have documented 63 terrestrial species and discerned predictable seasonal and interannual structure to avian assemblages, at least through an extended dry period. Recent studies in the matorral habitats of the park indicate seasonal patterns that fall into 4 patterns: year-round residents, winter visitors, summer breeders, and transients. Short-term banding studies demonstrate co-occurring wintering and breeding cohorts among species of Sierra-finches (Phrygilus) in the park; such assemblages and dynamics are reminiscent of North American Mediterranean avian assemblages and pose interesting ecological comparisons. In this period of surveys there appears to have been a gradual transition of the avifauna that may be a response to anthropogenic influence and/or climate change. Research on the foraging behavior of 2 insectivorous species indicate that one of these is convergent on better-known North American taxa while the other clearly is not; these efforts suggest useful avenues for further comparative research. A remarkable coevolutionary association between the Chilean Mockingbird (Mimus thenca) and endoparasitic mistletoes (Tristerix) provides insight into potential convergent ecologies in desert regions with different evolutionary histories.Less than 1% of the park comprises temperate forest remnants that subsist due to extensive water input from fog. Research in these remnants has emphasized the role of habitat fragmentation on avian assemblage composition and on reproductive ecology by forest-dependent species. The avifauna here comprises a subset of that found in intact Valdivian rainforest to the south, and forest remnant size alone explains over 90% of the variation in species numbers. One species has been particularly well studied; the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda) is more abundant and has higher nestling survival in larger fragments. We summarize other work on stress responses and variation in song structure in this species. Finally, the role of birds in tree recruitment here has important implications in the face of a recent history of reduction in sizes of forest remnants; numerous birds consume the fruit of the dominant tree, olivillo (Aextoxicon punctatum), but they fail to promote successful recruitment because they defecate viable seeds in locations that provide poor survival of seedlings.Ornithological research in Chile is undergoing a modest renaissance, and while dryland avifaunas are characterized more by what is not known and has yet to be studied than by actual ecological understanding, they provide a baseline for many exciting studies ranging from natural history to the role of migration to comparative dynamics of independent lineages in North and South America. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urbanization has been identified as a threat to biodiversity due to landscape modifications. Studies of parasite ecology in urbanized areas lagged behind those made on macro organisms. Here we studied infection prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in an avian community of an urban forest from Germany, and its relationship with bird abundance and body mass. We used PCR to amplify a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b gene to determine the infection status of birds, and bird point counts to determine bird relative abundances. The avifauna was dominated by two small sized insectivore passerines (Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus), representing ~40 % of the total bird records. The highest haemosporidian prevalence was recorded for Turdus philomelos (100 %) and for Fringilla coelebs (75 %). Bird abundance and body mass were positively associated with infection status for two haemosporidian genera: Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon. Infection rate was lower in juveniles compared to adult birds. We recorded a total of 7 Plasmodium, 26 Haemoproteus, and 10 Leucocytozoon lineages. Avian malaria (P. relictum) was detected infecting 5 individuals of P. major, the most abundant species in the community. These results, together with those of previous studies at the same site, suggest that potentially any of the genetic haemosporidian lineages detected in this urban forest can be transmitted across native and pet bird species, and to species of conservation concern housed at aviaries. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - With the intensification of human activities, preserving animal populations is a contemporary challenge of critical importance. In this context, the umbrella species concept is appealing because preserving a single species should result in the protection of multiple co-occurring species. Practitioners, though, face the task of having to find suitable umbrellas to develop single-species management guidelines. In North America, boreal forests must be managed to facilitate the recovery of the threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Yet, the effect of caribou conservation on co-occurring animal species remains poorly documented. We tested if boreal caribou can constitute an effective umbrella for boreal fauna. Birds, small mammals, and insects were sampled along gradients of post-harvest and post-fire forest succession. Predictive models of occupancy were developed from the responses of 95 species to characteristics of forest stands and their surroundings. We then assessed the similarity of species occupancy expected between simulated harvested landscapes and a 90 000-km2 uncut landscape. Managed landscapes were simulated based on three levels of disturbance, two timber-harvest rotation cycles, and dispersed or aggregated cut-blocks. We found that management guidelines that were more likely to maintain caribou populations should also better preserve animal assemblages. Relative to fragmentation or harvest cycle, we detected a stronger effect of habitat loss on species assemblages. Disturbing 22%, 35%, and 45% of the landscape should result, respectively, in 80%, 60%, and 40% probability for caribou populations to be sustainable; in turn, this should result in regional species assemblages with Jaccard similarity indices of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively, relative to the uncut landscape. Our study thus demonstrates the value of single-species management for animal conservation. Our quantitative approach allows for the evaluation of management guidelines prior to implementation, thereby providing a tool for establishing suitable compromises between economic and environmental sustainability of human activities. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Understanding how animals move in a complex habitat mosaic is critical to biodiversity conservation as deforested lands and secondary rainforests accumulate in landscapes previously dominated by primary forests. To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary forest recovery after pasture abandonment, we formed a conceptual model predicting avian space use during a temporal sequence beginning with deforestation and continuing through regrowth of old secondary forest. We tested five predictions of the model at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil, using 73 radio-tagged understory insectivores of three species: two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, Xiphorhynchus pardalotus) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma). Both woodcreepers provided evidence to support all predictions except that of greater path tortuosity in primary forest. Woodcreepers using secondary forest had larger home ranges, larger core areas, and faster movement rates than in primary forest. Further, the proportion of all species' core areas in primary forest exceeded the proportion of home ranges in primary forest. Formicarius colma showed a fundamentally different pattern than the woodcreepers: it essentially avoided secondary forest until 27-31 years after pasture abandonment, at which point movements were indistinguishable from those in primary forest. Formicarius colma and other terrestrial insectivores show implastic spatiotemporal responses to recovering secondary growth, which we suspect contributes to the sensitivity of this guild to forest disturbance. Quantifying the value of marginal (and economically inconsequential) habitats such as secondary forest will be essential as land managers strive to maintain species persistence and connectivity in increasingly heterogeneous tropical landscapes. © 2015.

AB  - Ecosystem services, such as pest control and pollination, are critical benefits of biodiversity important for agricultural production. Predators, including insectivorous birds and ants, can provide important biological controls in agroecosystems, boosting crop yield and offsetting the need for expensive inputs such as pesticides. Local habitat and landscape characteristics can affect the delivery of ecosystem services, thereby influencing optimal land allocation for crop production and biodiversity. In order to better understand the relationship between ecosystem services and the surrounding habitat, we conducted a sentinel pest experiment to investigate predation levels in response to a novel pest on coffee farms in central Kenya. The frequency of predation decreased significantly with increasing distance from adjacent forest fragments and was correlated with bird species richness. Predation was also significantly higher on shade compared to sun coffee farms. We conclude that a land sharing approach, via both the integration of shade trees and the conservation of small forest fragments within or adjacent to a farm, can support increased levels of pest control services provided by birds and ants in Kenyan coffee farms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Demographic parameters of birds are essential to understand their ecology and delineate conservation and management plans. This becomes especially important in highly altered biomes such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, since the few remaining fragments bear mostly secondary forests where demographic parameters might differ from old-growth forests. Few studies about territory sizes and density have been conducted for entire bird communities or groups of species in the Neotropical region, with a bias towards Central America and the Amazon. In this work we determined territories of Atlantic Forest birds in order to assess their size and density. We conducted spot-mapping in a rectangular 40-ha plot within a 384-ha of secondary semideciduous forest fragment in Vicosa region, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We identified 260 territories of 30 species of insectivorous birds. Mean territory size of all species was 2.4 ha, ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 ha. The mean density for all species was 21.7 pairs/100 ha, ranging from 2.5 to 72.5 pairs. The sizes of the territories of many Atlantic Forest birds were by far smaller, and the density higher, than those of conspecific or congeneric species from Amazonian or Central American forests. These geographical differences in territory size and density can be explained by at least two non-exclusive hypotheses: 1) higher primary and secondary productivity in advanced successional secondary forest fragments and; 2) density compensation, given the loss of other competitor species. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

AB  - Human activities have modified landscapes worldwide, promoting fragmentation and isolation of forest habitats. Such landscape modifications are responsible for changes in species composition due to extinction and colonization events. Forest species dynamism is usually affected by forest fragmentation when remaining fragments are small and isolated, but forest dynamism is usually more stable when forest fragments are large and connected. In this study we verified changes in bird composition during 23 years of bird monitoring at the Mata dos Godoy State Park (PEMG). We aimed to evaluate the avian community dynamism of this reserve, as well as its effectiveness in protecting biodiversity in an extremely fragmented landscape. We reviewed historical records of bird species composition and checked for any possible misidentifications, updated the list and created an annual data set of bird species occurrence. We used this list to evaluate species persistence, species loss, and colonization over the study period. Additionally, species were classified according to their guilds in order to determine which species traits were associated with local extinction. A total of 331 bird species were recorded in PEMG over 23 years of monitoring, 17 of which were considered locally extinct or possibly extinct, and 11 were recent local colonizations. This indicates that bird composition in PEMG has been relatively stable over the years. However, local extinction was more likely for large frugivores and insectivores, which are guilds already known to be more susceptible to local extinction. Colonizations, in turn, were associated with guilds of more open habitats, like edge insectivores. We suggest that extinctions and colonizations are also potentially related to species distribution ranges and climate change. Although local extinctions occurred, PEMG still maintains a significant fraction of its historical avifauna and may potentially maintain source populations for many bird species, thus making it an important reserve for the north of Paraná. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

AB  - Abstract: This article analyzes the process of forest fragmentation of a floodplain landscape of the Lower Amazon over a 30-year period and its implications for the biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to the riverine population. To this end, we created a multi-temporal forest cover map based on Landsat images, and then analyzed the fragmentation dynamics through landscape metrics. From the analyses of the landscape and bibliographic information, we made inferences regarding the potential impacts of fragmentation on the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. Subsequently, we used data on the local populations' environmental perception to assess whether the inferred impacts on biodiversity are perceived by these populations and whether the ecosystem services related to the biodiversity of the addressed groups are compromised. The results show a 70% reduction of the forest habitat as well as important changes in the landscape structure that constitute a high degree of forest fragmentation. The perceived landscape alterations indicate that there is great potential for compromise of the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. The field interviews corroborate the inferred impacts on biodiversity and indicate that the ecosystem services of the local communities have been compromised. More than 95% of the communities report a decreased variety and/or abundance of animal and plant species, 46% report a decrease in agricultural productivity, and 19% confirm a higher incidence of pests during the last 30 years. The present study provides evidence of an accelerated process of degradation of the floodplain forests of the Lower Amazon and indicate substantial compromise of the ecosystem services provision to the riverine population in recent decades, including reductions of food resources (animals and plants), fire wood, raw material and medicine, as well as lower agricultural productivity due to probable lack of pollination, impoverishment of the soil and an increase of pests. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Roads immersed in conservation areas will increase in number, size, and traffic over the next decade, and thus, understanding their effects on forest-dependent wildlife is crucial for improving current management practices and reducing the negative impacts of roads on sensitive species. We examined the influence of route 32 (a.k.a. Guápiles Highway) on temporal and spatial changes in the structure of the avifauna of Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica, a site crossed by this road along 25 km. The highway connects the capital city of San José with the Harbor of Limón in the Caribbean Sea (142 km). Although the road is narrow (12 m in width and comprised by two lanes along most of the route) it services over 1.5 million motor vehicles per year, 12 % are heavy trucks and trailers. We expected the highway to divide the avifauna, and thus to observe significant differences in species structure on opposite sides of the road. We described changes in bird diversity between wet and dry seasons at Las Palmas and Ceibo trails located on opposite sides of the highway (14 point counts per trail), and evaluated how abundance and diversity varied with road distance. Censuses took place during wet and dry seasons from 2002 to 2005. We listed 245 species and 6 035 observations during the 4-yr survey. Rare species dominated the avifauna (65 % of species < 5 observations), and species overlap between trails was high (Sorensen= 71 %; Morisita= 0.96). Species accumulation curves varied little among trails, yielding 190 species. Resident species represented 70 % of observations, followed by elevational (15 %) and long-distance migrants (1-2 %). Understory species were the most abundant (60 %) followed by canopy birds (30 %). Species turnover rate was 55 % between seasons, but species composition between trails remained homogeneous. Overall, birds were avoiding the road (abundance increased away from the road) although other diversity parameters (richness, dominance, Shannon index, and equitability) were not influenced by road proximity. Although the avifauna remained homogeneous on both sides of the road, which did not support the fragmentation hypothesis, the highway reduced the abundance and diversity of specialized understory insectivores associated with primary forests near the road. This highway will expand outside the National Park (from 2 to 4 lanes along 107 km from Río Frío to Limón) in the next years, which will increase traffic volume and road impacts within the Park. Roads are increasing across highly diverse tropical areas justifying the need for management practices based on the identification of sensitive groups. © 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - The Mixed Rain Forest (Araucaria Forest) is currently restricted to less than 1% of the original area, occurring in different succession stages and degrees of preservation. This paper presents the influence of the gradient of succession vegetation and the phenomenon of bamboo (Merostachys aff. multiramea) flowering and fruiting on a bird community in an area of Araucaria forest on Santa Catarina. Between 2009 and 2010, 20 monthly samples were performed using the methodology of capturing and marking using mist-nets in three successional stages (initial, intermediate and advanced). During sampling, the fruiting of bamboos began in January 2010, allowing an equivalent sampling before and after the event. A total of 557 individuals belonging to 77 species were captured. The highest relative abundances occurred to Haplospiza unicolor (AR = 20,80%), due to the relationship of this species with bamboos in flowering. The highest relative abundance ocurred for 58,44% of the species, pattern already reported in studies using mist-nets in neotropical forests. The highest diversity was found in the initial stage (H’=3,45), followed by intermediate and advanced sucessional stages. However, the equitability is more pronounced in the intermediate stage. The Jaccard similarity index showed that the initial stage is the most different in their composition avifauna in relation with others. The results also showed that the opening of gaps due to the death of bamboos after flowering has a similar role that occurring with habitat fragmentation, with specific impacts in understory insectivores and understory omnivores. © 2016, Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - Context: Climate change may amplify the effects of land-use change, including induced changes in interspecific interactions. Objectives: To investigate whether an avifauna changed over a period of severe drought, and if changes in avifaunas were related to changes in vegetation characteristics and the irruption of a despotic native species, the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. Methods: In the box–ironbark forests of south-eastern Australia, we resurveyed the avifaunas and remeasured vegetation characteristics in 120 forest transects in 2010–2011 that had previously been measured in 1995–1997. Results: The avifauna changed markedly over the prolonged drought, and changes were more marked in smaller fragments of remnant vegetation in which more pronounced vegetation change had occurred. The noisy miner increased differentially in smaller remnants adding to the declines, especially for small-bodied birds. Conclusions: Long droughts interspersed with short wet periods are projected for the region, so the imposition of climate effects on an already much-modified region has profound implications for the avifauna. The noisy miner has (and continues) to benefit from both land-use and climate change, so future sequences of drought interspersed with short wet periods are likely to lead to further changes in the avifauna as the miner extends its occupancy. Differential reductions in small nectarivores and insectivores will affect ecosystem processes, including the control of defoliating insects, seed dispersal and pollination. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Avian communities in cloud forests have high levels of endemism and are at major risk given the accelerated rate of habitat fragmentation. Nevertheless, the response of these communities to changes in fragment size remains poorly understood. We evaluated species richness, bird community density, community composition, and dominance as indicators of the response to fragment size in a fragmented cloud forest landscape in central Veracruz, Mexico. Medium-sized fragments had statistically higher than expected species richness and more even communities, which may be a reflection of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, in which medium- sized fragments are exploited by both forest and disturbance-associated species. Bird density also reached higher values in medium- sized fragments, which may indicate a carrying capacity in this habitat. However, large cloud forest fragments had a distinct taxonomic and functional composition, attributable to an increased number of understory insectivore species and canopy frugivores. By comparison, omnivorous species associated with human-altered habitats were more abundant in smaller fragments. Hence, although medium-sized cloud forest fragments had higher species richness and high bird density, large forest tracts maintained a distinct avian community composition, particularly of insectivorous and frugivorous species. Furthermore, the underlying response to fragmentation can only be properly addressed when contrasting several community attributes, such as richness, density, composition, and species dominance. Therefore, cloud forest conservation should aim to preserve the remaining large forest fragments to maintain comprehensive avian communities and avoid local extinctions. © 2015 by the author(s).

AB  - Avian diversity in fragmented Amazonian landscapes depends on a balance between extinction and colonization in cleared and disturbed areas. Regenerating forest facilitates bird dispersal within degraded Amazonian landscapes and may tip the balance in favor of persistence in habitat patches. Determining the response of Amazonian birds to fragmentation may be hindered because many species use adjacent second growth matrices thereby limiting the applicability of island biogeography to predict species loss; alternatively, a countryside biogeographic framework to evaluate the value of regenerating forest may be more appropriate. Here, we used point-count and capture data to compare Amazonian bird communities among continuous forest, 100 ha forest fragments with adjacent second growth, young and older second growth plots, and 100 ha forested islands bounded by water, to test the applicability of island biogeography on the mainland and to assess the ecological value of a regenerating matrix. Among foraging guilds, understory insectivores and flocking species were nearly absent on true islands. Fragments surrounded by young second growth were species rich, suggesting that a developing matrix may mitigate extinction associated with fragmentation. Our findings reinforce that true islands are often extinctiondriven systems with distinct, depauperate communities. In contrast, succession of bird communities in second growth facilitates recolonization of forest fragments, permitting fragments as small as 100 ha to support bird communities similar to continuous forest. © 2015 DuFour et al.

AB  - Primary tropical rain forests are being rapidly perforated with new edges via roads, logging, and pastures, and vast areas of secondary forest accumulate following abandonment of agricultural lands. To determine how insectivorous Amazonian understory birds respond to edges between primary rain forest and three age classes of secondary forest, we radio-tracked two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, N = 17; Xiphorhynchus pardalotus, N = 18) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma, N = 19). We modeled species-specific response to distance to forest edge (a continuous variable) based on observations at varying distances from the primary-secondary forest interface. All species avoided 8-14-yr-old secondary forest. Glyphorynchus spirurus and F. colma mostly remained within primary forest <100 m from the young edge. Young F. colma rarely penetrated >100 m into secondary forest 27-31 yr old. Young Formicarius colma and most G. spirurus showed a unimodal response to 8-14-yr-old secondary forest, with relative activity concentrated just inside primary forest. After land abandonment, G. spirurus was the first to recover to the point where there was no detectable edge response (after 11-14 yr), whereas X. pardalotus was intermediate (15-20 yr), and F. colma last (28-30 yr +). Given the relatively quick recovery by our woodcreeper species, new legislation on protection of secondary forests > 20-yr old in Brazil's Pará state may represent a new opportunity for conservation and management; however, secondary forest must mature to at least 30 yr before the full compliment of rain forest-dependent species can use secondary forest without adverse edge effects. © 2015 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.

AB  - The food habits and niche overlap based on diet composition and prey size of two species of understorey insectivorous birds were investigated in an area of montane rain forest in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. A total of 43 birds were captured: 33 individuals of Conopophaga lineata (Conopophagidae) with 13 recaptures, and 10 individuals of Myiothlypis leucoblephara (Parulidae) with 12 recaptures, from which were obtained respectively 33 and 10 fecal samples. Fragments of 16 groups of arthropods, plus insect eggs, were identified in these samples. Conopophaga lineata predominantly consumed Formicidae (32%) and Isoptera (23.6%). However, the index of alimentary importance (AI) of Isoptera (3.53) was lower than other groups such as Formicidae (AI = 61.88), Coleoptera (AI = 16.17), insect larvae (AI = 6.95) and Araneae (AI = 6.6). Myiothlypis leucoblephara predominantly consumed Formicidae (28.2%) and Coleoptera (24.4%), although Coleoptera and Hymenoptera non-Formicidae had the highest values of AI (38.71 and 22.98 respectively). Differences in the proportions of the types of arthropods consumed by birds were not enough to reveal their separation into feeding niches (overlap = 0.618, p observed ≤ expected = 0.934), whereas differences in the use of resources was mainly due to the size of the prey (p<0.001), where C lineata, the species with the highest body mass (p<0.001) consumed larger prey. It is plausible that prey size is an axis of niche dimension that allows the coexistence of these species. © 2015, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Competitive interactions among species with similar ecological niches are known to regulate the assembly of biological communities. However, it is not clear whether such forms of competition can predict the collapse of communities and associated shifts in ecosystem function in the face of environmental change. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional trait data to test whether communities of two ecologically important guilds of tropical birds (frugivores and insectivores) are structured by species interactions in a fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. In both guilds, we found that forest patch size, quality, and degree of isolation influence the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of communities, with small, degraded, or isolated forest patches having an increased signature of competition (i.e., phylogenetic and functional trait overdispersion in relation to null models). These results suggest that local extinctions in the context of fragmentation are nonrandom, with a consistent bias toward more densely occupied regions of niche space. We conclude that the loss of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is mediated by niche-based competitive interactions among species, with potentially far-reaching implications for key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal and plant damage by phytophagous insects. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The avifauna of a 70-ha forest fragment located in the North of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil was analyzed. The trophic structure, preferential habitats, relative abundance, and frequency of occurrence of the species were studied, with the aim of analyzing the conservation status of the sampled area. Pre-existing trails in the fragment were used as linear transects and they were monthly coursed between October 2012 and September 2013. Hundred-twenty species of birds were recorded; November and December 2012 had the highest bird abundance and species richness. Forty-two species were registered in 25% of the samples and 39 species in 25.1% - 50% of the samples. The trophic categories with highest diversity were insectivorous, omnivorous and frugivorous. The obtained data indicated that the sampling area plays an important role in the conservation of the local avifauna, housing many species with dependence of environments showing low levels of human disturbance. © 2015, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

AB  - Insectivorous birds are known to play a decisive role for the natural control of herbivorous insects. Thus, they enhance the growth, reproduction, and survival of plant individuals and in the long-term benefit plant regeneration. However, particularly in the tropics, forest fragmentation has been suggested to cause a loss of insectivorous birds. Yet, it is unclear whether this hampers the trophic control of herbivorous insects with potential consequences for plants. Therefore, we investigated the effect of increasing forest fragmentation on tritrophic interactions between insectivorous birds, herbivorous insects, and plants in a subtropical forest landscape, South Africa. We monitored the community composition of birds and estimated insectivorous bird abundances along a gradient of forest fragmentation. In the same sites, we installed bird exclosures on a common plant species (Englerophytum natalense) to assess effects of the trophic control of insectivorous birds on herbivorous insects and leaf area loss (LAL). Forest fragmentation strongly shaped the functional composition of bird communities, particularly through a loss of forest-dependent insectivorous birds. Moreover, LAL was higher within bird exclosures than on control branches and increased with increasing forest fragmentation on the control branches. Altogether, forest fragmentation seems to hamper the trophic control of herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds through changes in the community composition. This, in turn, may interfere with tritrophic interactions and ecological processes. Thus, conservation efforts aiming at enhancing the natural control of herbivorous insects should focus on the maintenance of continuous indigenous forests that are well-connected to smaller forest fragments on the landscape scale. © 2015 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.

AB  - The management of rainforest ecosystems for multi-species conservation must assess the impacts of habitat degradation at different spatial scales as well as determine which species are vulnerable to landscape change. Our research objectives were to (1) evaluate the effects of life history traits on the patch occupancy and vulnerability of rainforest birds, (2) determine the relative effects of stand, landscape and patch structure on species richness, and (3) evaluate the relative contributions of deforestation and fragmentation to species richness. We collected presence-absence data for 29 bird species in 46 rainforest patches in South East Queensland, Australia. We used a multi-species occupancy model that accounted for incomplete detection to evaluate hypotheses for occupancy and species richness. Avian occupancy was strongly influenced by life history traits, including population density, foraging behavior, dispersal strategy, clutch size, body mass and diet. Sedentary species with low population sizes, low clutch sizes, large body sizes and insectivorous diets, such as the ground-dwelling Albert's Lyrebird (Menura alberti) and canopy-dwelling Paradise Riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), were the most vulnerable to landscape change. After accounting for life history, the positive effect of stand basal area was the best predictor of species richness followed by the positive effects of rainforest and dry eucalypt forest in the landscape, with less support for the positive effect of patch size and negative effect of patch isolation. Deforestation was more detrimental to the bird community than rainforest fragmentation. Conservation actions that retain high stand basal area, promote unmodified landscape mosaics and maintain moderate patch sizes near large rainforest tracts are expected to be effective strategies for managing the rainforest bird community. Landscape conservation strategies to minimize habitat loss are expected to be more effective than managing the configuration of rainforest patches. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat destruction and degradation are major drivers of biodiversity loss and attention is increasingly focused on how different traits of species affect their vulnerability. Dietary traits are critical in this respect, and are typically examined by assigning species to different feeding and foraging guilds. However, such guilds may mask large variation in species' trophic interactions, limiting our understanding of species' responses. Here we use stable isotopes to quantify trophic positions within a Family of insectivorous understory birds, the Timaliidae (babblers), within Bornean rainforests. We then relate changes in species' abundances following intensive selective logging of forest to their trophic positions, body sizes and foraging heights. We found that trophic positions within this single feeding guild spanned more than an entire trophic level. Moreover, changes in abundance following logging were significantly and independently related to mean trophic position in primary forest, body size and foraging height: large ground-feeding species occupying high trophic positions were more adversely affected than small understory-feeders with lower trophic positions. These three variables together explained 81% of the variance in species' responses to logging. The single most important predictor, however, was a species' mean trophic position. Species recorded in both habitats also had significantly higher trophic positions in logged forest. These data provide critical new understanding of species' responses to disturbance. They also indicate previously unrecognised functional changes to species assemblages following logging, highlighting the importance of numerical assessments of trophic position within individual feeding guilds. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of forest fragmentation on mixed-species foraging bird flocks has been poorly evaluated, particularly in African forests. We examined the consequences of forest fragmentation on such flocks in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, by addressing ecological as well as behavioral components. We counted these flocks in five small (<31 ha), isolated fragments and six widely spaced continuous forest sites. Given that flock cohesion and stability might be facilitated via positive interactions of leader or nuclear species, we focused on one putative nuclear species, the square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus ludwigii), and using playback of its vocalisations, we evaluated (i) if its vocalisations attracted flocking birds as expected by a nuclear species, and (ii) if loss of this species in fragments contributed to flock declines. We found that flocks in forest fragments had smaller sizes, reduced species richness, a reduced proportion of understorey specialists, a higher proportion of forest generalists and non-forest species, and were more variable in size and composition compared to flocks observed in continuous forest. Furthermore, flocks in fragments were composed of a higher proportion of omnivores than insectivores. Despite lower absolute abundance in fragments, D. ludwigii was observed in 86% of natural occurring flocks in both fragments and continuous forest, and flocks with D. ludwigii were significantly larger than those without it--especially in the continuous forest. Playback vocalisations of D. ludwigii attracted flocks of similar abundance and species richness in fragments and continuous forest, but a vastly different composition, confirming (i) its nuclear role and (ii) that, in fragments, flock assemblages had a distinct composition, with a high proportion of forest generalists and non-forest species. Loss or diminished abundance of nuclear species due to fragmentation may be an important factor that affects the presence and composition of mixed-species flocks. Given that 67% of flocking species forage in the understorey, and that insectivores were more negatively affected in fragments than omnivores, the implications of our findings are relevant for conservation in tropical forests. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many insectivorous birds of the tropical rainforest understory, particularly terrestrial species, are prone to local extinctions in fragmented forests. We evaluated the hypothesis that vegetation structural changes in rainforest fragments reduce the availability of microhabitats used by terrestrial insectivores. Near Manaus, Brazil, we compared the vegetation in forest fragments to the vegetation in a continuous forest site where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging. Our focal species included those that are extinction prone in fragments (Myrmornis torquata [Wing-banded Antbird], Grallaria varia [Variegated Antbird], Hylopezus macularius [Spotted Antpitta]), a fragmentation-tolerant species (Myrmothera campanisona [Thrush-like Antpitta]), and species that have and intermediate response (Myrmeciza ferruginea [Ferruginous-backed Antbird], Formicarius colma [Rufous-capped Anttrush], Formicarius analis [Black-faced Antthrush], Conopophaga aurita [Chestnut-belted Gnateater], and Corythopis torquata [Ringed Antpipit]). To quantify vegetation, we measured sixteen habitat variables in 8-m radius plots where birds were observed foraging as well as random points in continuous forest and forest fragments of 1-, 10-, and 100-ha. Four principal components were produced from a principal component analysis and we selected a variable (leaf litter depth, plant cover 3-10. m, density of plants 1-2. m, and plant cover >20. m) from each principal component for our fragment vs continuous forest comparisons. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we estimated the probabilities that the density of plants 1-2. m, proportion of plant cover 3-10. m, and leaf litter depth increased with decreasing fragment area and also exceeded the values associated with fragmentation-sensitive species. We also tested the prediction that plant cover >20. m decreased in forest fragments and that those sites became more open than typical sites used by our focal species. Our predictions were strongly supported: decreasing fragment size was correlated with increasing density of tall plants, increasing mid-story vegetation cover, decreased canopy cover, and increasing leaf litter depth. Even if our focal species are able to disperse to small forest fragments, our results suggest that they may not find enough appropriate habitat. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Patterns of habitat specialization can be used to infer conservation risks for species whose habitats are being degraded or lost due to anthropogenic activity. We assigned levels of forest type specialization to birds based on their occurrence and local abundance in three basic types of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil: seasonal semi-deciduous forest, mixed rainforest, and dense rainforest. We hypothesized that forest types would contain birds characterized by different levels of specialization. Specifically, we predicted that the dense forest would contain more specialists due to its higher plant species richness. Our study focused on a major clade of the suboscine Passeriformes (Thamnophilidae-Furnariidae), the majority of which are understory insectivorous species. We used field data from 16 locations including 35 sites spanning the major forest types in southern Brazil. We found (1) substantial variation in abundance among sampling locations for a single bird species within and between forest types; (2) species-specific associations with forest types; and (3) spatial aggregation among species that share similar levels of specialization. Using our method of qualitative scoring of forest type specialization, three species were considered habitat specialists (. Xenops minutus, Leptasthenura setaria, and Cranioleuca pallida), twelve species were moderate specialists, sixteen were generalists, five were complete generalists, and twelve species were too rare to be included in the analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, both mixed and dense forests were equally dominated by specialists. We discuss the implications of our approaches for conservation assessment and planning, both at the single-species level and for aggregate species in assemblages. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understory insectivorous birds often disappear from fragmented tropical rainforest landscapes before mechanisms such as increased rate of nest depredation can be evaluated. Here, we took advantage of chestnut-backed antbird (. Myrmeciza exsul), a representative rainforest understory insectivore that persists in fragments (unlike many other understory species), to identify variables influencing nest predation rate and to test the hypothesis that nest predation underlies avian extirpation in tropical fragments. We compared nest predation rates, bird density, and predator identities in three habitats of lowland Caribbean Costa Rica: two fragments, a peninsular reserve (La Selva Biological Station), and unfragmented rainforest. Our results suggest an inversely density-dependent nest predation pattern: In fragments, chestnut-backed antbirds reached their highest density and-contrary to predictions-experienced their lowest nest predation rates; La Selva on the other hand experienced the lowest density and highest predation rate. Because nest predation decreased with fragmentation, it appears not to explain declines of understory insectivores from forest fragments generally. Nest survival models indicated that habitat best explained nest predation likelihood, whereas edge, annual, and nest age effects were unimportant. Video surveillance documented both bird-eating snake (. Pseustes poecilonotus) causing 80% of nest loss overall (37 of 46 nests) and a larger variety of predators in fragments; thus, landscape factors influenced an understory bird's nest predation. Given the large effect on our focal species, Pseustes likely affects other understory nesters, a topic warranting further study. Tropical reserve conservation plans should consider potential impacts of specialized nest predators on vulnerable understory birds. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Most woody plants are animal-pollinated, but the global problem of habitat fragmentation is changing the pollination dynamics. Consequently, the genetic diversity and fitness of the progeny of animal-pollinated woody plants sired in fragmented landscapes tend to decline due to shifts in plant-mating patterns (for example, reduced outcrossing rate, pollen diversity). However, the magnitude of this mating-pattern shift should theoretically be a function of pollinator mobility. We first test this hypothesis by exploring the mating patterns of three ecologically divergent eucalypts sampled across a habitat fragmentation gradient in southern Australia. We demonstrate increased selfing and decreased pollen diversity with increased fragmentation for two small-insect-pollinated eucalypts, but no such relationship for the mobile-bird-pollinated eucalypt. In a meta-analysis, we then show that fragmentation generally does increase selfing rates and decrease pollen diversity, and that more mobile pollinators tended to dampen these mating-pattern shifts. Together, our findings support the premise that variation in pollinator form contributes to the diversity of mating-pattern responses to habitat fragmentation.

AB  - We investigated how legal logging history and recent illegal logging affected forest bird community structure in Ghana. Ghanaian forests belong to West Africa's highly fragmented Upper Guinea rain forests, part of a global priority "biodiversity hotspot" under intense pressure from anthropogenic degradation. Between 1995 and 2010, officially-reported legal logging intensities increased up to ~600%, while illegal logging, which now accounts for 80% of timber extraction in Ghana, has driven logging intensities to ~6 times greater than the maximum sustainable rate. We collected data in 2008-2010 and used a comparable dataset collected in 1993-1995 to assess impacts of recent logging on understory bird communities in large forest fragments (100-524km2) in southwest Ghana. Forest understory bird species abundance declined by >50% during this period. Species richness also showed declining trends. Whereas analysis based on data collected in 1993-1995 estimated a partial post-logging recovery of the understory bird community at that time, data from 2008-2010 showed no indication of post-logging recovery, likely due to ongoing illegal logging following intensive legal logging operations. Forest generalist species and sallying insectivores declined significantly in logged compared to unlogged forests. These severe declines of Upper Guinea forest understory birds indicate the rapidly deteriorating conservation status of a biodiversity hotspot and could signal collapsing ecosystem processes. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to protect surviving forest fragments from further degradation and avian declines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus spirurus (n=19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n=18), and the terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n=19). Forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest-the oldest at our site. Our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30. years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Local abiotic conditions (microclimates) vary spatially and selection of favorable microclimates within a habitat can influence an animal's energy budgets, behavior, and ultimately, fitness. Insectivorous birds that inhabit the understory of tropical forests may be especially sensitive to environmental variation and may select habitat based on microclimatic (e.g. temperature, humidity, light) conditions. Sensitivity to microclimate could contribute to the population declines of understory insectivores in response to forest fragmentation or degradation, which changes the physical structure of the forest, thereby increasing light intensity and temperature and decreasing humidity. To understand the role of microclimates in the habitat selection of understory insectivores, we characterized the microclimatic associations of nine species of understory insectivores at three sites along a precipitation gradient and across seasons in central Panama. We compared the distributions of microclimates selected by birds with microclimates at randomly chosen points within their home ranges to test for microclimate selectivity. We predicted that: (1) birds would select microclimates that are more humid, cooler, and less bright than random microclimates, (2) selectivity would be greater in hotter, drier habitats and (3) selectivity would be greatest in the dry season. We found no evidence of selectivity for the nine species we sampled on a seasonal or spatial basis. Microclimate variation was minimal in the forest understory at all sites, particularly in the wet season. Understory insectivores did not use microhabitats characterized by high light intensity, and may be sensitive to light, though the mechanism remains unclear. The lack of microclimate variation in the understory of tropical forests may have serious fitness consequences for understory insectivores due to increasing temperatures associated with climate change coupled with a lack of thermal refugia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forest fragmentation influences community composition via differential species-level effects. Avian responses to fragmentation at La Selva Biological Station are, in part, responsible for the particular concern over the fate of understory insectivorous species. However, since the 1990s, much previously deforested land within and surrounding La Selva has reverted to forest, providing an opportunity to test hypotheses explaining ongoing avifaunal change. Analyses of 23. years (1989-2011) of Christmas Bird Counts reveal that 63 of 202 species have increased whereas 44 are declining, with declines occurring more rapidly than increases. Habitat association was an important predictor of population trends, as understory birds continue to decline whereas forest generalists increased. Our results differ from previous work in the tropics by revealing that, at La Selva, insectivores are not currently suffering greater declines than birds of other dietary guilds. Instead, body size was more strongly associated with population change than was diet, with smaller birds having more negative population trends than larger birds. These results suggest that we must consider additional hypotheses that may explain ongoing population declines of tropical birds. In particular, the associations between population trends and body size implicate physiological mechanisms influencing population change, which may result from direct or indirect consequences of changing climates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognized as the main causes for the global biodiversity crisis. Most of the studies investigating the issue of habitat fragmentation in vertebrates are cross-sectional, whereas long-term studies are least available. We surveyed bird communities in 17 forest fragments (FF) and a single continuous forest stands (CF) in central Italy twice, 10 years apart (i.e. in 1996 and in 2006). All community parameters showed a contrasting pattern between 1996 and 2006, i.e. an increase of abundance and diversity measures in CF and a decrease or a stability of the same parameters in FF. Insectivorous and migratory bird species were the most prone to population declines associated with fragmented landscapes. Differences in species turnover between CF and FF were due to a higher extinction rate in the latter forest type. There was substantial population increase between 1996 and 2006, especially in FF, of opportunistic predator species like corvids. This fact may be responsible for the observed dropping in species number, evenness and diversity in FF. Hence, we conclude that, in FF, the bird community is far from being either stabilized or resilient, as it is rapidly evolving into a more simplified assemblage, dominated by generalist species. © 2015, The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - Soundscape assessment has been proposed as a remote ecological monitoring tool for measuring biodiversity, but few studies have examined how soundscape patterns vary with landscape configuration and condition. The goal of our study was to examine a suite of published acoustic indices to determine whether they provide comparable results relative to varying levels of landscape fragmentation and ecological condition in nineteen forest sites in eastern Australia. Our comparison of six acoustic indices according to time of day revealed that two indices, the acoustic complexity and the bioacoustic index, presented a similar pattern that was linked to avian song intensity, but was not related to landscape and biodiversity attributes. The diversity indices, acoustic entropy and acoustic diversity, and the normalized difference soundscape index revealed high nighttime sound, as well as a dawn and dusk chorus. These indices appear to be sensitive to nocturnal biodiversity which is abundant at night in warm, subtropical environments. We argue that there is need to better understand temporal partitioning of the soundscape by specific taxonomic groups, and this should involve integrated research on amphibians, insects and birds during a 24 h cycle. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy, acoustic evenness and the normalized difference soundscape index. This study has demonstrated that remote soundscape assessment can be implemented as an ecological monitoring tool in fragmented Australian forest landscapes. However, further investigation should be dedicated to refining and/or combining existing acoustic indices and also to determine if these indices are appropriate in other landscapes and for other survey purposes. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest fragmentation and agricultural development are important anthropogenic landscape alterations affecting the disease dynamics of malarial parasites (Plasmodium spp.), largely through their effects on vector communities. We compared vector abundance and species composition at two forest edge sites abutting pastureland and two forest interior sites in New Zealand, while simultaneously assessing avian malaria prevalence in silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). Twenty-two of 240 (9.2%) individual silvereyes captured across all sites tested positive for avian malaria, and Plasmodium prevalence was nearly identical in edge and interior habitats. A total of 580 mosquito specimens were trapped across all sites. These comprised five different species: the introduced Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus; the native A. antipodeus, C. asteliae and C. pervigilans. The known avian malaria vector C. quinquefasciatus was only recorded in the forest edge (mostly at ground level). In contrast, the probable vector C. pervigilans was abundant and widespread in both edge and interior sites. Although frequently caught in ground traps, more C. pervigilans specimens were captured in the canopy. This study shows that avian malaria prevalence among silvereyes appeared to be unaffected by forest fragmentation, at least at the scale assessed. Introduced mosquito species were almost completely absent from the forest interior, and thus our study provides further circumstantial evidence that native mosquito species (in particular C. pervigilans) play an important role in avian malaria transmission in New Zealand. © 2015, International Association for Ecology and Health.

AB  - In recent decades, the consequences of habitat fragmentation have been of growing concern, because it is particularly important to understand how fragmentation may affect biodiversity, an ecological service. We tested two hypotheses: (1) that natural fragment size in agricultural landscapes indirectly affects the herbivore through effects on natural predator populations; and (2) predator activity into the crop reduces along the distance from the natural fragment edge. From 2008 and 2009, we conducted our study in seven forest remnants and in surrounding coffee plantations (fragments ranged from 6 to 105 ha, mean 49.28 ± 36.60 ha) in Southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Birds were sampled by point counts, and insect predation was evaluated by using an artificial insect model (Koh and Menge 2006). Our results suggest that although there were many potential predators (e.g., wasps, ants, birds, and mammals), birds were the most important taxon unit. The covariance analysis supported the hypothesis that patch size affected the number of larvae predation by overall taxi, but there was no support for a distance effect. These findings suggest that natural enemies’ ecological service (mainly from birds) declined with remnant reduction, which has implications not only for human welfare, but also in strengthening the economic justifications for conserving the remaining natural habitats and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A major conservation objective of wildlife overpasses is to maintain levels of dispersal between fragmented areas of habitat, thereby allowing gene-flow and sustaining population viability of target species. We documented crossing rates of a range of avian species, of four defined species guilds, over a vegetated 15. m wide wildlife overpass in suburban Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The overpass spanned a 60. m wide major arterial road, and linked two areas of isolated sub-tropical eucalyptus forest. Crossing rates of these species guilds were also determined over the major road, and two other high-traffic roads, 20 and 90. m wide respectively.Species guilds differed markedly in their crossing rates of the overpass, and in their method of crossing. They also differed in their relative ability to cross high-traffic roads of different width. Our results indicate that, although honeyeater and large forest insectivore guilds made extensive use of the wildlife overpass as a foraging resource and as a conduit between forest areas, the conservation value of wildlife overpasses in relation to potential gene-flow lies mainly with the small insectivore species guild, predominantly with forest-dwelling species of lower bodyweight and with flight characteristics not well-suited to sustained direct flight. Differences between species within this guild may be linked to a range of inter-related factors, including flight capacity, habitat use, and evolutionary history.Overpasses specifically for birds have rarely, if ever, been constructed. It would, however, be relatively simple to incorporate narrow, linear strips of appropriate vegetation strata into multi-purpose overpasses to benefit these target species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim: We investigated the contribution of parasitism by the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) to its host population dynamics at a subcontinental scale. We predicted that the growth rate of cowbirds would be most strongly related to the abundance of forest insectivorous hosts and that landscape fragmentation would have opposite effects on the parasite and its hosts. Furthermore, due to the species' sedentarity and low rates of adult dispersal, we expected that cowbird population dynamics would be structured at local, rather than large spatial scales. Location: The Great Plains, United States. Methods: We modelled jointly the population dynamics of cowbird and its 58 most common hosts, accounting for effects of landscape fragmentation and cowbird dispersal. We used Bayesian inference to evaluate this model on 76 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), surveyed each year from 2001 to 2011. We then analysed covariations between the demographic dynamics of cowbirds and their hosts in a multivariate ecological trait space. Results: Contrary to most of its hosts, the cowbird had positive growth rates in man-disturbed, fragmented landscapes, which covaried at small spatial scales. The large-scale effects of parasitism were limited, as few host species affected, or were affected by cowbird growth rates. However, significant cowbird-host relationships were structured by ecological traits: cowbird growth rates were most increased by the abundance of ecological generalists, while hosts were affected by cowbird abundance irrespective of their position in the functional space. Main conclusions: Cowbirds parasitize opportunistically the hosts occurring in disturbed landscapes. The large-scale effects of nest parasitism therefore depend probably on landscape structure and other environmental factors operating at local scales. We suggest that efforts to counter the local and continental declines of many passerine species should include parasitism among the biotic components of landscape disturbance. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A diverse assemblage of plant macrofossils and the associated representative palynofloral elements are documented from the early Eocene subsurface beds of the Cambay Shale Formation exposed in an open cast lignite mine at Vastan Village in the Surat District, western India. The Vastan mine succession is cyclic, each cycle representing a transgressive burial event terminating in the low energy lagoonal conditions. The higher energy cycle begins with sandy lenses having rich biotic remains, followed by mudstones and molluscan shell beds and ends with lignite seams. The dominantly muddy facies and the associated biota demonstrate predominantly low energy near shore or coastal plain depositional setting with conditions varying from dominantly marine (shallow) through brackish to fresh water. The Vastan mine is a well dated fossil locality with a rich and diverse biota of mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, fish, insects, molluscs, foraminifers, dinoflagellates, and plants. The plants comprise leaf and fruit impressions, seeds, fruits, wood fragments, mangrove rooting structures, fungal thalli and spores, pteridophytic spores, and angiosperm pollen grains. Thirteen macrofossil species, including several morphotaxa, are represented by the families Calophyllaceae, Rutaceae, Anacardiaceae, Rubiaceae, Combretaceae, Lythraceae, Sapindaceae, Malvaceae, and Ebenaceae. The palynological assemblage representing fourteen taxa includes the new species, Notothyrites undulatus, Callimothallus semicircularis, and Carallioipollenites integerrimoides. Habitat and distribution of modern taxa comparable with the fossil assemblage from Vastan suggest a terrestrial lowland environment. The macrofossil taxa are indicative of mesophytic, mixed forest growing under tropical to subtropical climate with sufficient humidity. The occurrence of dipterocarp elements along with taxa such as Swintonia, Pterospermum and Diospyros, etc. seems to suggest the presence of a tropical rain forest in the vicinity of Vastan. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bird populations have declined in many parts of the world but most of those declines can be attributed to effects of human activities (e.g., habitat fragmentation); declines in areas unaffected by human activities are not common. We have been sampling bird populations at an undisturbed site in lowland forest of eastern Ecuador annually since 2001 using a combination of mist nets and direct observations on two 100-ha plots. Bird numbers fluctuated on both plots during the first 8 years but did not show a consistent pattern of change. Since about 2008, numbers of birds on both plots have declined; capture rates in 2014 were ~40% less than at the start of the study and observation rates were ~50% less. Both understory and canopy species declined in abundance. Overall, insectivores showed the most pronounced declines but declines varied among trophic groups. The period from 2008 onward also was a period of stronger La Niña events which, at this study site, are associated with increased rainfall. The mechanism for the declines is not known but likely reflects a combination of reduced reproductive success coupled with reduced survival associated with changing climate. © 2015 Blake and Loiselle.

AB  - Controlling herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds is one of the most important regulating services in forest ecosystems. The fragmentation of forests and the associated increase of edge effect, however, influences forest bird communities and thereby may have an impact on biological control via the modification of prey-predator interactions. In the present study we aimed to examine how insectivorous bird abundance and their predation on artificial caterpillars were affected by forest edges and vegetation structure in fragmented temperate forests of southwest Hungary. We found an unexpected negative humpedshaped pattern for predation rate as well as for bird abundance, having peaks both at the edge and in the interior (50 m from the edge). We found a positive correlation between bird abundance and predation rate, therefore the important role of birds in insect pest control was supported. Interestingly, the abundance of insectivorous birds had negative relationships to forest structure variables, such as tree basal area and tree species richness. This unexpected pattern may be a result of the context-dependency of edge effects that cannot be fully explained by our study. It highlights the need for more studies to explore the general pattern of edge effect on insect pest control.

AB  - Aim: Forest fragmentation is often accompanied by an increase in hunting intensity. Both factors are known drivers of species extirpations, but understanding of their independent effects is poor. Our goal was to partition the effects of hunting and fragmentation on bird species extirpations and to identify bird traits that make species more vulnerable to these two stressors. Location: Menglun, Yunnan, SW China Methods: We studied the landscape within 10 km radius of Menglun town, where forests have become highly fragmented by monoculture rubber plantations. We compiled data on birds recorded between 1954 and 1983 before forest loss and compared it with a checklist prepared between 2011 and 2014. We used countryside and matrix-calibrated species-area models (SAMs) to estimate the observed slope of forest bird extirpations in Menglun and compared it with the slope expected in the absence of hunting. We also investigated six ecological traits to determine those that best explained bird extirpation probability (EP). Results: We found that 34% of the bird fauna had been extirpated from the study landscape, and the estimated slopes of countryside and matrix-calibrated SAMs for forest birds were around 1.4 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than the 0.35 expected without hunting. Bird EP was strongly associated with size, and understorey insectivores that are known to be susceptible to fragmentation were less susceptible to hunting than frugivores. Given evidence of past and present hunting activity in the area, and the lack of support for alternative explanations, we suggest that hunting increased forest bird extirpations by around 1.3- to 1.6-fold. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of using species-area relationships to separate area effects from the impacts of hunting. Our results suggest that hunting substantially increases species extirpations in tropical fragmented landscapes and conservation interventions that only target deforestation will therefore be inadequate. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Some understory insectivorous birds manage to persist in tropical forest fragments despite significant habitat loss and forest fragmentation. Their persistence has been related to arthropod biomass. In addition, forest structure has been used as a proxy to estimate prey availability for understory birds and for calculating prey abundance. We used arthropod biomass and forest structural variables (leaf area index [LAI] and aerial leaf litter biomass) to explain the abundance of White-breasted Wood-Wrens (Henicorhina leucosticta), tropical understory insectivorous birds, in six forests in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. To estimate bird abundance, we performed point counts (100-m radius) in two old-growth forests, two second-growth forests, and two selectively logged forests. Arthropod abundance was the best predictor of wood-wren abundance (wi = 0.75). Wood-wren abundance increased as the number of arthropods increased, and the estimated range of bird abundance obtained from the model varied from 0.51 (0.28 - 0.93 [95%CI]) to 3.70 (1.68 - 5.20 [95%CI]) within sites. LAI was positively correlated to prey abundance (P = 0.01), and explained part of the variation in wood-wren abundance. In forests with high LAI, arthropods have more aerial leaf litter as potential habitat so more potential prey are available for wood-wrens. Forests with a greater abundance of aerial leaf litter arthropods were more likely to sustain higher densities of wood-wrens in a fragmented tropical landscape. © 2014 Association of Field Ornithologists.

AB  - Habitat complexity in reforested stands has been acknowledged as a key factor that influences habitat use by birds, being especially critical for habitat disturbance-sensitive species such as tropical understory insectivorous birds. Most studies regarding the relationship between forest structure and species diversity were conducted at the landscape scale, but different diversity patterns may emerge at a finer scale (i.e., within a habitat patch). We examined a tropical reforested area (State of Caldas, Colombia), hypothesizing that insectivorous bird richness, abundance, and foraging guild abundance would increase as intra-habitat complexity increases. We established 40 monitoring plots within a reforested area, measured their structural features, and determined their relationships with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance, using Generalized Additive Models. We found that the increasing variation in basal area, stem diameter, and number of stems was positively correlated with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance. Relationships between richness or abundance and structural features were not lineal, but showing curvilinear responses and thresholds. Our results show that heterogeneity on basal area, stem diameter, and the number of stems was more correlated to insectivorous bird richness and abundance than the average of those structural features. Promoting structural variation on reforested areas by planting species with different growth rates may contribute to increase the richness and abundance of a tropical vulnerable group of species such as the understory insectivorous birds. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - In northeastern Brazil, the reduction of the natural forest cover to a series of small, isolated fragments has had negative consequences for the local avian fauna, in particular, a loss of the more specialized species, while the populations of some generalists have tended to increase. The present study focuses on the composition and trophic groups of a bird community on a farm in the northeastern Brazilian state of Alagoas. Monthly surveys were conducted between November 2008 and October 2009, based on mistnetting and systematic observations. Overall, 112 species were recorded, of which 76 were associated with the two forest fragments surveyed, while all the others were observed exclusively in the surrounding matrix of pasture and orchards. The bird community presented a predominance of insectivorous species, followed by omnivores. However, specialized trunk-creeping and understory insectivores accounted for only around 15% of the species in this feeding category. The reduced diversity of other guilds and species with more specialized diets, and the complete absence of sensitive species such as large parrots and raptors, reflects the severe fragmentation and degradation of the local forests, which has greatly reduced the availability of dietary resources and breeding sites. © 2014, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - A prevalent environmental contaminant, mercury (Hg) is mobile and persistent in aquatic systems, where it often occurs in its bioavailable form methylmercury. Because methylmercury can bioaccumulate in aquatic insects and then transfer to terrestrial food webs, riparian consumers reliant upon aquatic emergent insects, should be disproportionately affected. Using the aerial insectivore Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) as a focal species, we examined (1) the extent to which total Hg loads in breeding flycatchers affected body condition and reproductive output and (2) potential pathways of contaminant flux in 19 riparian forest fragments distributed across an urban-to-rural landscape gradient in Ohio, USA. From April-August 2011-2012, we collected blood samples from adult (n=76) and nestling (n=17 from 7 nests) flycatchers, monitored their annual reproductive success (i.e., total number of fledglings), and sampled water, sediment, and aquatic emergent insects at each site. Hg concentrations in adult flycatcher blood (47 to 584μg/kg, x-=211.8, SD=95.5) were low relative to published advisory levels and not related to body condition. However, even at low concentrations, blood Hg was negatively related to reproductive success, with a 0.83 decline in the number of fledglings per μg/kg (log<inf>e</inf>) increase of blood Hg. Adult flycatchers had 11× greater concentrations of blood Hg than their offspring. Hg levels in flycatcher blood were not predicted by Hg concentrations in sediment, water, or aquatic emergent insects, with the exception of rural landscapes alone, in which flycatcher Hg was negatively related to sediment Hg. In addition to illustrating the difficulty of predicting exposure pathways that may vary among landscape contexts, our study provides evidence that even trace levels of contaminants may impair reproductive success of free-living songbirds. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global increases in both agriculture and biodiversity awareness raise a key question: Should cropland and biodiversity habitat be separated, or integrated in mixed land uses? Ecosystem services by wildlife make this question more complex. For example, birds benefit agriculture by preying on pest insects, but other habitat is needed to maintain the birds. Resulting land use questions include what areas and arrangements of habitat support sufficient birds to control pests, whether this pest control offsets the reduced cropland, and the comparative benefits of "land sharing" (i.e., mixed cropland and habitat) vs. "land sparing" (i.e., separate areas of intensive agriculture and habitat). Such questions are difficult to answer using field studies alone, so we use a simulation model of Jamaican coffee farms, where songbirds suppress the coffee berry borer (CBB). Simulated birds select habitat and prey in five habitat types: intact forest, trees (including forest fragments), shade coffee, sun coffee, and unsuitable habitat. The trees habitat type appears to be especially important, providing efficient foraging and roosting sites near coffee plots. Small areas of trees (but not forest alone) could support a sufficient number of birds to suppress CBB in sun coffee; the degree to which trees are dispersed within coffee had little effect. In simulations without trees, shade coffee supported sufficient birds to offset its lower yield. High areas of both trees and shade coffee reduced pest control because CBB was less often profitable prey. Because of the pest control service provided by birds, land sharing was predicted to be more beneficial than land sparing in this system.

AB  - Aim: The role of bird-insect interactions in shaping bird distribution patterns at the landscape scale has been seldom investigated. In mosaic landscapes, bird functional diversity is considered to be an important driver of avian insectivory, but depends on forest fragmentation and edge effects from adjacent, non-forest habitats. In a transcontinental experiment, we investigated edge and landscape effects on bird functional diversity and insectivory in mosaic landscapes of mixed forests and open habitats. Location: New Zealand and France. Methods: We paired edge and interior plots in native forest fragments in New Zealand and native plantation forests in France. We sampled bird communities using point-counts and linear transects respectively and simultaneously quantified avian insectivory as the rate of bird attacks on plasticine models mimicking tree-feeding Lepidoptera larvae. The same seven life traits and attributes were compiled for French and New Zealand birds, including biogeographic origin, body mass, mobility, foraging method, adult diet, nest location and clutch size. Bird functional diversity was quantified on this multitrait basis by four indices: functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion. We used mixed models to test for the effects of forest edges, study area, surrounding landscape diversity and native forest cover on bird functional diversity and insectivory. Results: We found higher bird functional richness at forest edges than interiors in New Zealand and lower functional richness at edges in France. However, bird functional evenness and divergence were significantly higher at forest edges in the two countries. Functional evenness and dispersion both increased with landscape diversity and evenness increased with native forest cover. Moreover, bird insectivory increased at forest edges with functional evenness, irrespective of the study area. Main conclusions: We suggest that intermediate levels of forest fragmentation and edge effects increase avian insectivory in mosaic landscapes, through enhanced functional evenness and trait complementation within predatory bird assemblages. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Avian molt, or the regularly scheduled replacement of feathers, is an important life history event, particularly in central Amazonian rainforest birds for which a relatively high proportion of the annual cycle can be dedicated to this process. Here, we detail molt strategies of 18 antbird species (Thamnophilidae) based on 2,362 individuals captured from lowland tropical rainforest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragmentation Project near Manaus, Brazil. All species exhibited a molt strategy consistent with the Complex Basic Strategy, in which birds undergo an inserted preformative molt within the first cycle, but apparently lack prealternate molts. The preformative molt and resulting formative plumage aspect of the 18 antbird species can be grouped by three distinct patterns: 1) a complete molt resulting in an adult-like formative plumage without molt limits; 2) a partial molt involving body feathers, lesser coverts, at least some or all median and greater coverts, and sometimes tertials or rectrices, resulting in an adult-like formative plumage with molt limits; and 3) a partial molt as in '2' but resulting in an adult female-like formative plumage in both sexes with plumage maturation delayed in males until the second prebasic molt. In addition, we show that one species, Percnostola rufifrons, exhibited an extra inserted molt (a partial auxiliary preformative molt) in the first cycle before initiating a complete preformative molt making this, to our knowledge, the first description of an auxiliary preformative molt for a suboscine. The extent of the preformative molt or delayed plumage maturation was not predicted by ecological guild, raising questions about how phylogenetic relatedness and ecological adaptation drive variation in molt patterns across antbirds. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - We describe Leucocytozoon quynzae sp. nov. (Haemosporida, Leucocytozoidae), which is the first Leucocytozoon parasite identified to species level in hummingbirds. It was found in the Amethyst-throated Sunangel (Heliangelus amethysticollis, Trochilidae, Apodiformes) captured in the Palacio Forest, which belongs to the damping zone of Chingaza National Natural Park, Cundinamarca, Colombia, at 2,900 m above sea level where the transmission occurs; the new species were found both in the high Andean forest and Paramo ecosystem. This parasite is described based on the morphology of its blood stages, a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, and the complete mitochondrial genome. Illustrations of blood stages of the new species are given, and the phylogenetic analysis places this lineage in a well-supported clade with other lineages of unidentified to species level leucocytozoids reported in the Trochilidae birds elsewhere. The new species possess gametocytes in roundish host cells; it can be readily distinguished from other similar leucocytozoids, primarily due to (1) a comma-like shape of the host cell nucleus, which extended one half or less of the circumference of the gametocyte and (2) a large number of prominent volutin granules in the cytoplasm. Identical mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence of Leucocytozoon quynzae was found in different hummingbird species at the type locality and also was reported in one passerine bird at the highlands of Peru. Leucocytozoon quynzae is the first leucocytozoid parasite described from South American birds; its transmission occurs both at low temperatures and high elevations. We discuss some patterns of distribution of avian leucocytozoids in South America and the role of Gigantodax spp. (Diptera, Simuliidae) as potential vectors of Leucocytozoon parasites in the Andean Region. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Understory insectivorous birds are sensitive to fragmentation due to their limited dispersal abilities. This limited dispersal makes these species an important group for conserving the landscape connectivity. Through telemetry methods, banding individuals, capture-recapture techniques, and visual observations, we evaluated Chestnut-backed Antbird individuals (Myrmeciza exsul, a common nonmigratory understory insectivorous and forest specialist with low mobility), to determine the home-range size in two fragmented landscapes in southwestern Costa Rica. Additionally, we recorded vegetation data in each one detected home area. We found significant differences (t = -3.52, P = 0.002) between landscapes regarding home-range sizes (1.02-2.76 ha at Los Cusingos Landscape [LCL, N = 19] and 0.77-1.80 at Boruca Landscape [BOL, N = 19]). Additionally, average core areas were estimated between 0.14 and 1.08 ha at LCL and between 0.05 and 0.52 ha at BOL. We concluded that Chesnutbacked Antbird home-range size was influenced by vegetation variables such as basal area and tree density, whereas core area was affected by landscape type. © 2014 The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - Forest fragmentation is the main process of destruction of the Atlantic Forest that creates heterogeneous environments that affect the structure and stability of ecological communities. The present study aimed to characterize the bird communityin a riparian forest remnant along the Chapecozinho river, in southern Brazil, between 2006 and 2009. The birds were analyzed for their predominant diet, preferential habitat, frequency of occurrence and relative abundance. One hundred and five species of birds were recorded. The seasons with highest species richness were spring 2007 and winter 2008. The more representative trophic categories were insectivorous (n=44), omnivorous (n=29) and frugivorous (n=10). Most species were classified as forest birds (n=48). The results showed that the forest remnant may be suffering fromanthropogenic pressures because: (1) seasonal patterns were not verified; (2) generalists and species from open areas were more dominant, such as Guira guia (RA=2,81%), Pyrrhura frontalis (RA=2,66%) and Theristicus caudatus (RA=2,51%). The significant number of omnivores in the area of study corroborates other studies in the region, suggesting that the area suffered environmental changes. © 2014 by Unisinos.

AB  - Ecosystem degradation leads to loss of interactions between animals and plants, and changes in frequency of pollination systems, dispersal modes and sexual systems of plants. The objective of the present work was to compare the reproductive ecological groups of tree species among semideciduous seasonal forests remnants in the Triangulo Mineiro, Brazil, and to understand the organization of those plant communities. We analyzed the reproductive biology of 243 tree species found in 10 fragments, which showed different levels of disturbance. The occurrence and relative density of the species were used to estimate the importance of each reproductive feature. The study was based on a compilation of data present in specialized works and community surveys conducted in the region. We aggregated the species of these communities in ecological groups according to their reproductive characteristics. The frequency of species in each reproductive ecological group was, to a certain extent, similar between remnants. The pollination by small insects (small bees, wasps and flies) represented 42%, dispersal by birds 35%, and hermaphrodite sexual system 54% of the species. Clearer differences among fragments were found on the relative densities of each reproductive ecological group. Relatively specialized bat and moth pollination, as well as wind dispersal were common in the most disturbed fragment. But generalist reproductive characteristics predominated in the studied fragments. © 2014, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and habitat quality interact synergistically and can drastically affect survival and fitness of insect herbivores. Here, we perform a case study to assess the effect of habitat quality and fragmentation on the morphology of a large, mobile, generalist insect herbivore, the bird locust, Ornithacris cyanea (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Four isolated, semi-natural grassland fragments within an exotic timber plantation matrix were ranked in terms of their habitat quality on the basis of vegetation surveys, management actions, and habitat context surrounding the fragments. Mark-release-recapture was used to estimate bird locust population size. Bird locusts from each fragment were measured for nine morphological characters: four length characters and five asymmetry and phenodeviation characters expected to be indicative of developmental instability. The highest density of individuals was found in an intermediate-quality fragment. Individuals from the poorest quality fragment had significantly shorter hind femurs than those from the best-quality fragment. Females from the poorest quality fragment also had significantly shorter forewings and more forewing pattern phenodeviation than females from other fragments. Morphological differences among the four populations indicated that they were distinct and that the population at the poorest quality site displayed adaptation for reduced mobility and increased developmental instability. Although we cannot determine whether populations were distinct due to inherent preferences of the species or as a result of reduced movement because of the inhospitable matrix, the correlation of morphological differences with habitat quality indicates that even highly mobile, generalist species can undergo rapid adaptations within isolated fragments and in response to varying habitat quality.

AB  - Industrial timber plantations severely impact biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Forest fragments survive within plantations, but their conservation value in highly deforested landscapes in Southeast Asia is poorly understood. In this study, we compared bird assemblages in acacia plantations and fragmented forests in South Sumatra to evaluate each habitat's potential conservation value. To clarify the impact of habitat change, we also analyzed the response of feeding guild composition. Five habitat types were studied: large logged forest (LLF), burnt logged forest (BLF), remnant logged forest (RLF), 4-year-old acacia plantation (AP4), and 1-year-old acacia plantation (AP1). Estimated species richness (Chao 2) was highest in LLF then AP4 and BLF, while AP1 and RLF had lower estimated species richness. Community composition was roughly divided into two groups by non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination: acacia plantation and logged forest. Sallying substrate-gleaning insectivores, such as drongos, broadbills, and some flycatchers, were restricted to LLF, whereas acacia plantation hosted many terrestrial frugivores, such as doves. Although fragmented forests in our study site lacked several common tropical forest species, these fragments provide an important habitat for some sallying and terrestrial insectivores. A network of small riparian remnant forests could be a complementary habitat for some species, while the conservation value of burnt forest might be low. In conclusion, the highly fragmented forests in plantations are suboptimal habitats for birds but are still very important, because large primary forest blocks have been nearly lost in the surrounding landscape. © 2014 The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - We investigated the diet of gracile mouse opossum, Gracilinanus agilis (Burmeister, 1854), from the analysis of 144 fecal samples collected between November 2009 and October 2011 in an area of savanna riparian forest in the Brazilian Cerrado. Invertebrates were the most frequently consumed food items (96.5%) followed by fruits of pioneer species (29.8%) and flowers (6%). We also observed the presence of fragments of bird vertebrae and downs in samples from 2 adult males, this being the first record of predation on small vertebrates by G. agilis. The presence of fragments of birds in the feces of the gracile mouse opossum suggests that despite the small size of this species and its primarily insectivorous habits, small vertebrates may be included in its diet. © SAREM, 2014.

AB  - The domestic cat Felis silvestris catus is considered a potential threat to the native fauna of regions it populates, particularly when it has free access to these areas. Although this problem is known in Brazil, little is known regarding the effects of this species on natural areas. This study aimed to obtain information concerning the diet of domestic cats by identifying the main items found in fecal samples from domestic cats. In addition, the effects of seasonality on the diet were examined, as it has been hypothesized that seasonal variation of food items has little influence of the diet of the domestic cat. These semi-domiciled cats are thought to face a constant and continuous supply food offered by their owners throughout the year. Feces were collected in a remnant fragment of an Atlantic Forest located south of the municipality of Ilha Comprida - SP, Brazil. These samples provided important information regarding the dietary ecology and predation behavior of this species in endangered forest areas. The results of the scat content analyses demonstrated that domestic cats inserted in this biome presented a generalist and opportunist diet with little seasonal variation, even when receiving food from their owners. The most frequently consumed groups of prey were insects (20.8%) followed by mammals (13.9%) and birds (4.0%). Although the cat is not the only factor that impacts the species of the region, management programs need to be established in conjunction with the local community with the aim of minimizing the pressure exerted by these animals on the native fauna. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Wildlife populations on Amami Island, Japan, have been affected by forest clear-felling and the introduction of alien species, in particular the mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus. We used monitoring data collected over 24 years to track changes in the population sizes of five species of mammals and 20 species of birds. We assigned species to the following groups: indigenous, rare, insectivorous, negatively affected by forest clear-cutting, and negatively affected by mongoose invasion. We examined trends in each group at four time points between 1985 and 2010 using two methods: species abundance estimates and the Living Planet Index. We then assessed the usefulness of these methods as tools for conservation planning. Inspecting species individually we identified four main patterns of abundance change: (a) an increase from the first to the last census period, (b) an increase in all periods except 2009-2010, (c) a decrease from 1985-1986 to 2001-2002 but an increase in 2009-2010, and (d) a decrease in all census periods. We observed certain relationships between these patterns and the species groups assigned as above. According to the Living Planet Index the group negatively affected by forest clear-cutting did not show significant recovery and the groups of rare species and species negatively affected by mongoose recovered to c. 40% of the original level after a sharp decline during 1985-2002. The Living Planet Index is a more useful tool for assessing the urgency of particular conservation needs, although limited information on species abundance reduces its representativeness for some groups. © Fauna & Flora International 2013.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation studies have produced complex results that are challenging to synthesize. Inconsistencies among studies may result from variation in the choice of landscape metrics and response variables, which is often compounded by a lack of key statistical or methodological information. Collating primary datasets on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in a consistent and flexible database permits simple data retrieval for subsequent analyses. We present a relational database that links such field data to taxonomic nomenclature, spatial and temporal plot attributes, and environmental characteristics. Field assessments include measurements of the response(s) (e.g., presence, abundance, ground cover) of one or more species linked to plots in fragments within a partially forested landscape. The database currently holds 9830 unique species recorded in plots of 58 unique landscapes in six of eight realms: mammals 315, birds 1286, herptiles 460, insects 4521, spiders 204, other arthropods 85, gastropods 70, annelids 8, platyhelminthes 4, Onychophora 2, vascular plants 2112, nonvascular plants and lichens 320, and fungi 449. Three landscapes were sampled as long-term time series (>10 years). Seven hundred and eleven species are found in two or more landscapes. Consolidating the substantial amount of primary data available on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in the context of land-use change and natural disturbances is an essential part of understanding the effects of increasing anthropogenic pressures on land. The consistent format of this database facilitates testing of generalizations concerning biologic responses to fragmentation across diverse systems and taxa. It also allows the re-examination of existing datasets with alternative landscape metrics and robust statistical methods, for example, helping to address pseudo-replication problems. The database can thus help researchers in producing broad syntheses of the effects of land use. The database is dynamic and inclusive, and contributions from individual and large-scale data-collection efforts are welcome. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Forest fragmentation affects seed production, but little is known about how seeds are distributed in fragmented forests after primary dispersion and how this affects their interactions with other organisms. This study addressed these issues in a fragmented oak forest of Quercus laeta where four habitat types were recognized: interior and edge of patches, deforested matrix around patches, and an abandoned field. Areas and distances to the abandoned field were measured for 40 patches, and acorns were sampled in all habitats. Only samples from the interior and edge of patches had acorns, which were classified as aborted, viable, and parasitized by insects or fungi. Acorns in all these classes were regressed against patch area and distance to the abandoned field. Field experiments were also conducted to determine whether acorn removal rates varied across habitats. Aborted acorns within patches were not related to area or distance, but they decreased with increasing values of both variables at patch edges. Within patches, viable acorns were positively related to increases in area and distance, while the converse occurred for insect-damaged acorns; fungal-infested acorns were not related to patch variables in this habitat. Complex interactions between area and distance explained how acorns in these classes were distributed across patch edges. Acorn removal was higher within patches and their edges when compared to human-disturbed habitats; both mice and birds were identified as potential acorn dispersers. These results suggest that forest fragmentation affects acorn-mediated processes and that this may influence the recovery of patch connectivity in the landscape. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Forest fragmentation results in a loss of forest interior and an increase in edge habitat. As a result, these changes may affect the bird species distribution and composition. We studied how understorey bird community composition and habitat variables changed along an edge-to-interior gradient in a fragmented lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. Birds and environmental variables were recorded at each of the 93 sampling points distributed along the 14 parallel transects that were systematically placed across the gradient of distance from the forest edge to the forest interior. Species composition was different along the edge-interior gradient, although only a few species were strictly confined to either edge or interior habitat. Based on bird-habitat associations along the edge-interior gradient, some of these edge-preferred species occurred in high numbers at the matrix surrounding the patch. In contrast, the interior-specialist group, mainly terrestrial insectivores, avoided the forest edge and was positively associated with humidity, canopy cover, the number of dead trees, percentage of litter cover, and depth of the litter layer. Species endemic to the Sunda subregion were more abundant in the interior of the forest. From a conservation perspective, forest remnants in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia that have a deep leaf litter layer, dense canopy cover, high number of dead trees, and high relative humidity are able to support understorey bird species that are sensitive to edge effects. The forest has important conservation value even though it is fragmented and isolated. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a dominant human impact worldwide with major implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although many studies have assessed the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity at local scales, our understanding of the ecological implications for different functional groups of organisms remains limited, particularly at global scales. Here, we use linear mixed models to explore patterns of occurrence and ecological function of 2844 bird species at 293 localities spanning five continents. We show that sensitivity to fragmentation varies according to functional group and body mass, with the prevalence of insectivores and large frugivores declining in relation to fragment size, particularly under 100. ha. However, the most severe effects were restricted to the tropics, whereas fragmentation had no significant impact on the basic ecological structure of temperate bird communities. We conclude that land-use change in tropical systems is likely to disrupt biotic processes, including seed dispersal and the control of insect herbivores. Our findings highlight the importance of latitude in mediating the impacts of habitat loss, and offer general guidelines for the minimum size of fragments required to prevent the collapse of key ecosystem processes in sensitive regions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - • Context: The Iberian cork oak Quercus suber montados are dynamic agro-silvo-pastoral systems, contrasting with the abandonment trend of other Mediterranean forested areas. • Aims: We aimed to identify the effect of management type and vegetation features on breeding insectivorous birds and leaf-chewing defoliator insects. • Methods: In central Portugal, we selected two groups of 20 sites: dense montados (DM, high cover of cork oaks and low cattle impact) and sparse montados (SM, low cover of oaks and high cattle impact). We collected variables associated with vegetation features, bird community and chewing defoliators. • Results: The two systems differed significantly in oak trunk diameter, oak and shrub cover, tree and shrub diversity. Ground bird densities were higher in SM with fragmented shrub cover. In DM, higher woody vegetation cover and diversity can promote shrub birds and leaf warblers. Oak defoliation was mainly attributed to the sawfly Periclista andrei. Sawfly defoliation was significantly higher in SM and negatively correlated with shrub cover. • Conclusions: Our results highlight (1) the relevance of management activities conducted at the shrubby layer, (2) the need of an increase in tree diversity and density and (3) the maintenance of a mosaic landscape in order to improve the bird community richness and reduce the defoliation impact in montado system. © 2012 INRA / Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Globally, relatively low-contrast matrices are being converted to high-contrast through increases in land uses such as surface mining. Such conversion affects biodiversity not only at the impact site, but also potentially in adjacent remnant habitat, particularly for habitat types such as tropical rainforest. We investigated how the species richness of different functional groups of tropical rainforest birds varied in remnant rainforest patches embedded in two matrix types (mining vs. agricultural) at two distances to forest edge in fragmented Upper Guinean rainforest landscapes of southwest Ghana. We hypothesized that rainforest adjacent to high-contrast surface mining would support a relatively lower richness of forest-dependent birds than that adjacent to a lower-contrast agricultural matrix. Data from six point counts at each of 32 study sites were used to estimate species richness within ten avian functional groups based on (a) habitat preference (forest specialists, generalists, forest visitors, open country species); and (b) food preference (carnivores, frugivores, omnivores, nectarivores, insectivores and granivores). Species richness of each group was modelled as a function of adjacent matrix type, distance to patch edge and site-level vegetation characteristics using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Forest specialists and frugivores were most strongly negatively affected by adjacent mining, irrespective of distance to forest edge. Forest visitors were more common in forests adjacent to agriculture than mining, and they preferred edges to interior habitats. Forest specialist and frugivore richness also correlated positively with the density of large trees. This effect of a high-contrast matrix on forest birds suggests that even with no additional forest loss, increased surface mining in the Upper Guinea region is likely to result in population declines in forest-dependent birds. Preserving biodiversity in forest landscapes will require management of matrix quality. The widespread trend of increasing patch-matrix contrast from land use change in the matrix is likely to result in negative consequences for biodiversity in fragmented tropical forest landscapes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the fragmented forest landscape of Europe, tree plantations comprise an increasingly important fraction of the matrix surrounding natural forest fragments. Plantations may provide habitat for forest biodiversity, which may enhance landscape connectivity and regional biodiversity. I compared the diversity and composition of bird communities in eucalypt plantations of three ages (young, intermediate and mature) and with low management intensity with respect to pine plantations, native forests and shrublands. Differences in composition of species and species groups were analyzed with PERMANOVA and visually represented using NMDS ordinations. Species groups were established according to diet, habitat and microhabitat preferences, and conservation status. A total of 887 bird encounters and 45 species were recorded. Native forests had the highest species richness per site and per sample, followed by pine plantations and shrublands. Eucalypt plantations had the lowest species richness, and decreasing with age, and the lowest bird abundance. According to composition, two habitat groups could be distinguished: wooded habitats, including native forests and plantations except young eucalypt plantations; and shrubby habitats, with shrublands and young eucalypt plantations. Native forests and pine plantations had the most similar composition among wooded habitats, and were associated with forest specialists, whereas species having unfavorable conservation status were associated with shrublands and young eucalypt plantations. In eucalypt plantations, birds were mainly associated with shrubs at young ages and with canopies at older ages, with flowers as an important food resource. The paucity of birds in eucalypt plantations contrasted with the diverse and abundant avifauna in pine plantations. The alien status and taxonomic isolation of Eucalyptus globulus in the region, together with specific features of its leaves and bark, may explain the low suitability of eucalypt plantations, by limiting the presence of phytophagous insects and thus the availability of prey for birds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our understanding of how anthropogenic habitat change shapes species interactions is in its infancy. This is in large part because analytical approaches such as network theory have only recently been applied to characterize complex community dynamics. Network models are a powerful tool for quantifying how ecological interactions are affected by habitat modification because they provide metrics that quantify community structure and function. Here, we examine how large-scale habitat alteration has affected ecological interactions among mixed-species flocking birds in Amazonian rainforest. These flocks provide a model system for investigating how habitat heterogeneity influences non-trophic interactions and the subsequent social structure of forest-dependent mixed-species bird flocks. We analyse 21 flock interaction networks throughout a mosaic of primary forest, fragments of varying sizes and secondary forest (SF) at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonian Brazil. Habitat type had a strong effect on network structure at the levels of both species and flock. Frequency of associations among species, as summarized by weighted degree, declined with increasing levels of forest fragmentation and SF. At the flock level, clustering coefficients and overall attendance positively correlated with mean vegetation height, indicating a strong effect of habitat structure on flock cohesion and stability. Prior research has shown that trophic interactions are often resilient to large-scale changes in habitat structure because species are ecologically redundant. By contrast, our results suggest that behavioural interactions and the structure of non-trophic networks are highly sensitive to environmental change. Thus, a more nuanced, system-by-system approach may be needed when thinking about the resiliency of ecological networks. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Aim: Reports of profound changes in species assemblages brought about by the influence of strongly interacting species are increasingly common. Where these strong interactors are sensitive to anthropogenic habitat changes, relatively small alterations in the environment can result in large and pervasive shifts in assemblages. We review the evidence for widespread assemblage-level phase shifts across eastern Australia, triggered partly by anthropogenic habitat alteration and mediated by a native, despotic bird: the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. Location: Eastern Australia. Methods: Based on the literature, we developed conceptual models of factors affecting site occupancy by, and ecosystem-level effects of, the noisy miner. We also analysed recent trends in the reporting rate of the noisy miner across its range. Results: Individuals of this species cooperate to aggressively exclude almost all smaller bird species from the areas they occupy. The noisy miner is advantaged by habitat fragmentation and structural simplification-habitat changes that facilitate detection and interception of potential competitors by miners. We report that the species is increasingly prevalent, particularly close to forest and woodland edges. Such edges have mainly been created by human land use. The evidence we reviewed showed: (1) strong causal links between the noisy miner and depressed richness and abundance of smaller birds, particularly nectarivores and insectivores; (2) moderate evidence of a positive association with larger bird species; (3) reduced tree condition stemming from impaired control of insect herbivore populations by smaller insectivores; and (4) a plausible negative effect on plant reproduction through reduced tree condition, altered pollination services and altered seed dispersal. Main conclusions: This is the first synthesis to document the causes and likely ecological consequences of increasingly prevalent phase shifts catalysed by a despotic species on ecosystems at very large spatial scales (&gt; 1 million km2). Native species affected by human activities can become agents that induce ecological dysfunction. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - The greater round-eared bat Tonatia bidens has a varied diet, consuming mostly insects, although it also feeds on small terrestrial vertebrates, such as rodents and birds. In 2008-2009, we expanded the knowledge of this species' feeding ecology by analyzing the diet of a T. bidens population in an Atlantic Forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. Food remains found in day shelters and feeding roosts included insects, birds, mammals and fruits. Insects, Lepidoptera, Blattodea, Coleoptera and Orthoptera, were the main component of the diet. There was a preferential consumption of the soft parts of insects and vertebrates, possibly because these parts are more easily digested and are the most nutritious. This first evidence of fruit consumption is also discussed. This analysis indicates that T. bidens has a more general diet than previously reported.

AB  - Many terrestrial species of birds have been observed to depend on large contiguous areas of forest; in the tropics this appears to be especially true for terrestrial insectivores. Far less is understood about how more-common species, that are less dependent on interior forests, use both forested and non-forested habitat in fragmented landscapes. Using both behavioral observations and radio-tracking relocation data, I quantified the within-territory use of different land cover types for three tropical songbird species, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina), red-throated ant-tanager (Habia fuscicauda), and cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans). Small forest fragments (<50. ha) were also surveyed for these same species. Territories of all three species were mostly forest (>75%), with different amounts of non-forested land cover. As predicted, all three species had increased use in forest cover and decreased use where neighboring territories overlapped. In addition all three species had higher use of areas where there were more forest gaps and/or 'soft edges' in the vicinity. Dusky antbirds were less likely to use monocultures of non-native grass and impervious surfaces, while the other two species had mixed responses to non-forested habitats. Dusky antbirds and cocoa woodcreepers were observed foraging at higher-than-expected frequencies along 'hard edges' of forested habitat. All three species were found in forest fragments even smaller than a minimal home range area estimate. Conservation of more-common bird species in fragmented landscapes can include secondary forests and small remnants but for these three species non-forested land cover alone would not be expected to provide breeding habitat. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although the eastern lowland rainforest of Madagascar houses a high proportion of endemic birds, little is known about how fragmentation effects and habitat loss specifically impact them. We analyzed published lists of forest birds across several eastern lowland rainforest fragments of three size classes (large: ~ 6,000 ha, medium: ~ 2,000 ha, small: ~ 600 ha) and varying distance (0.45-20 km) from a nearby continuous forest block. Several key species traits were incorporated to elucidate 1) patterns of species loss across forest fragments and the characteristics of lost species; 2) relationships of species richness and composition with fragment size and distance, and the factors that potentially drive these associations; and 3) pattern of nestedness in the resulting species assemblages. At the scale of our study, we found that species' vulnerability to loss was a function of degree of rarity and ecological specialization, such as insectivorous diet and habitat restriction. Fragment size was associated with species richness and composition. However, distance from the remaining continuous forest block and human disturbance, such as selective logging, may also influence their patterns of association. Both ecological factors and sampling effects (passive sampling of the regional species pool) appeared to influence species distribution across our fragments. Although no significant pattern of nested subset was detected among individual fragments, such a pattern is apparent among fragments from the three size classes. We briefly address conservation implications of these findings. © Rakotoarisoa and Capparella; Licensee Bentham Open.

AB  - Coffee agroforestry systems and secondary forests have been shown to support similar bird communities but comparing these habitat types are challenged by potential biases due to differences in detectability between habitats. Furthermore, seasonal dynamics may influence bird communities differently in different habitat types and therefore seasonal effects should be considered in comparisons. To address these issues, we incorporated seasonal effects and factors potentially affecting bird detectability into models to compare avian community composition and dynamics between coffee agroforests and secondary forest fragments. In particular, we modeled community composition and community dynamics of bird functional groups based on habitat type (coffee agroforest vs. secondary forest) and season while accounting for variation in capture probability (i.e. detectability). The models we used estimated capture probability to be similar between habitat types for each dietary guild, but omnivores had a lower capture probability than frugivores and insectivores. Although apparent species richness was higher in coffee agroforest than secondary forest, model results indicated that omnivores and insectivores were more common in secondary forest when accounting for heterogeneity in capture probability. Our results largely support the notion that shade-coffee can serve as a surrogate habitat for secondary forest with respect to avian communities. Small coffee agroforests embedded within the typical tropical countryside matrix of secondary forest patches and small-scale agriculture, therefore, may host avian communities that resemble those of surrounding secondary forest, and may serve as viable corridors linking patches of forest within these landscapes. This information is an important step toward effective landscape-scale conservation in Neotropical agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Hernandez et al.

AB  - Globally, many forests and woodlands are in decline. The marked loss of canopy foliage typical of these declines results in reduced foraging resources (e.g. nectar, pollen, and insects) and, subsequently, can reduce habitat quality for woodland birds. In south-west Western Australia, patches of Eucalyptus wandoo woodlands have shown a decline in condition since at least 2002. We investigated how changes in E. wandoo condition affect the woodland bird community. Foraging activities of three bird species were recorded for 20 sites in Dryandra State Forest and Wandoo Conservation Park either by conducting watches on focal trees ('sitting' method), or following individuals through the woodland ('following' method). Condition assessments of trees used by the birds were compared with those for trees available at the study site. Weebills (Smicrornis brevirostris; canopy insectivore) displayed preference for healthy trees (low amounts of canopy dieback), whereas rufous treecreepers (Climacteris rufa; bark-foraging insectivore) preferred trees with a higher proportion of dead branches. Yellow-plumed honeyeaters (Lichenostomus ornatus; insectivore/nectarivore) foraged in older, larger E. wandoo trees having full canopies with few signs of tree decline. Tree declines, such as that happening in E. wandoo, alter the foraging resources and habitat available to woodland birds. © CSIRO 2013.

AB  - Conversion of farmland land-use matrices to surface mining is an increasing threat to the habitat quality of forest remnants and their constituent biota, with consequences for ecosystem functionality. We evaluated the effects of matrix type on bird community composition and the abundance and evenness within avian functional groups in south-west Ghana. We hypothesized that surface mining near remnants may result in a shift in functional composition of avifaunal communities, potentially disrupting ecological processes within tropical forest ecosystems. Matrix intensification and proximity to the remnant edge strongly influenced the abundance of members of several functional guilds. Obligate frugivores, strict terrestrial insectivores, lower and upper strata birds, and insect gleaners were most negatively affected by adjacent mining matrices, suggesting certain ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal may be disrupted by landscape change in this region. Evenness of these functional guilds was also lower in remnants adjacent to surface mining, regardless of the distance from remnant edge, with the exception of strict terrestrial insectivores. These shifts suggest matrix intensification can influence avian functional group composition and related ecosystem-level processes in adjacent forest remnants. The management of matrix habitat quality near and within mine concessions is important for improving efforts to preserveavian biodiversity in landscapes undergoing intensification such as through increased surface mining. © 2013 Deikumah et al.

AB  - Introduction: Panstrongylus megistus is commonly found in wild environments of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the network of refuges used by triatomine in a forest fragment of Porto Alegre and to identify Trypanosoma cruzi infection, associated hosts and the epidemiological importance of both hosts and triatomines. Methods: Techniques including the spool-and-line method and active searching (transects) were used to identify natural foci. Results: The food source for each triatomine was determined using the precipitin test, and the infection of marsupials was determined by xenodiagnosis. A total of 33 adults (domestic environment) and 27 nymphs (wild environment) of P. megistus were found in addition to 43 Didelphis albiventris specimens. The infection rates of triatomine adults, triatomine nymphs and opossums with T. cruzi I were 64%, 73% and 69%, respectively. Birds, rodents and opossums were the main resources used by triatomine. Conclusions: This work presents the fi rst characterization of a natural focus of P. megistus in Rio Grande do Sul. The natural characteristics of this focus and its implication in the transmission of T. cruzi are discussed.

AB  - Urban avifaunal surveys in Brazil have been increasing in recent years, despite none of them consisting of long-term studies indicating events of regional colonization and/or missing species. Here, we present an avifaunal survey of an urbanized ecosystem in southeastern Brazil, carried out along 30 years, on the campus of the Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais, municipality of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state. Inside the campus there is a forest reserve adjacent to a small lake. The inventory was mainly based on opportunistic records from the years 1982-2013. We recorded 134 bird species along the past 30 years. However, the present avifauna is composed of 123 species. A total of 97 species was recorded in the reserve, including the forest fragment and the adjacent lake, of which 44 were exclusive to this area. Nevertheless, the majority of the current species found in the study area is forest independent (N = 51) or semi-dependent (N = 46). There is a predominance of insectivorous (N = 43) and omnivorous (N = 29) species. The current avifauna is represented by 15 migratory species, which can be found both in the urbanized area and in the forest remnant. However, the majority of the species (N = 75) is resident in the area, including three invasive species, whereas few others (N = 28) are occasional visitors. The remaining species were probably introduced in the area. There were 11 cases of disappearing species, which include typical forest birds, and also species typical of wetlands and rural environments. We also comment on recent colonization and on the possible effects of isolation on birds. Probably, the majority of forest-dependents are on the brink of extinction in the forest fragment. Thus, the species' list provided here can be useful as a database for monitoring long-term effects of urbanization on this bird community.

AB  - Declines of formerly widespread bird species are being increasingly reported, with habitat loss, agricultural intensification and reduced rainfall frequently implicated. We report on temporal changes in the occurrence of birds over 21 years within continuous forest in the Warrumbungle Mountains to evaluate the influence of rainfall variability on changes in the abundance of birds and species occurence. During this period, six common insectivores declined significantly (Superb Fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus; White-throated Gerygone, Gerygone albogularis; Grey Shrike-thrush, Colluricincla harmonica; Rufous Whistler, Pachycephala rufiventris; Grey Fantail, Rhipidura albiscapa; Eastern Yellow Robin, Eopsaltria australis). Rainfall significantly predicted the abundance of 13 of the 25 most common species, with the rainfall period of both July-December of the previous year and the combined effects of six years of January-June rainfall correlated with changes in the abundance of birds. Prolonged drought has likely driven food shortages (especially of litter-dwelling arthropods), with changes in avian community composition reflecting changes in food availability. Thus, avian declines in southern Australia may reflect the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and other landscape-scale changes in concert with larger-scale ecological processes driven by decreased rainfall. Improved linkages between forested and agricultural landscapes at the regional scale are needed to buffer against local fluctuations in resources. © 2013 Bird Life Australia.

AB  - The challenging question of predator-prey interactions contributing or not to limit insect outbreaks in forest ecosystems is still ongoing. Winter numerical responses of generalist insectivorous birds to overwintering larvae of a key pine defoliator, the pine processionary moth, has received little attention to date. Here, we tested the effects of forest structure and composition at stand and landscape scales on overwintering moth density and winter bird communities, including generalist moth predators. We assessed moth nest density and bird communities during two consecutive winters on 25 linear transects along an elevation gradient in mountain pine forests of the southern French Prealps. We found that winter severity significantly decreased both moth density and total bird abundance and richness. Pine processionary moth density increased with south-facing aspects and forest fragmentation, especially edge density, at the landscape scale. Winter bird communities were influenced more by forest fragmentation at the landscape scale than stand-scale variables, except moth density. Total bird abundance increased significantly with moth density only in the colder winter. Great tit Parus major abundance also increased significantly with moth density, but irrespective of winter severity. Winter bird numerical responses were mediated primarily by landscape composition, and secondarily by forest stand structure and composition. We suggest that landscape-scale conservation of bird functional diversity in both breeding and wintering seasons would increase opportunities for biological control of pest insects in mountain forests. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite many studies have documented that fragmentation facilitates biological invasions, studies performed in different taxonomic groups have observed contrasting patterns. Unfortunately, the use of different ecosystems and fragmentation metrics among studies does not allow assessing the generality of the effect of fragmentation on invasion among different taxa. Studies evaluating the simultaneous responses of exotic species from different taxonomic groups to the same fragmentation patterns may help to assess generality of this relationship. Temperate forests in coastal central Chile are largely a suite of fragments of different sizes surrounded mainly (but not exclusively) by Pinus radiata plantations. Here, we evaluated exotic species richness of vascular plants, insects, mammals and birds in the coastal Maulino forest in a continuous native forest, fragments of native forest and Pinus radiata plantations. Species richness of exotic species of all taxa varied similarly across landscape units. Plantations presented the highest number of exotic species, followed by fragments and finally the continuous forest. In addition, regarding all exotic species, landscape units showed a nested pattern in which most exotic species present in the continuous forest were also present in fragments; and most species present in fragments were present in the pine plantation as well. Our results suggest that fragmentation may affect invasion of different taxa in a similar way, and that continuous forests may efficiently resist invasion. Our results also suggest that given that most of the native forest of south-central Chile is distributed in small fragments, it seems urgent to start an exotic species control to maintain their conservation value.

AB  - Previous studies that tracked the movements of single bird species within human-modified landscapes have shown that the ability of forest birds to move across matrix habitat differs among species. Functional guild specificity as well as landscape characteristics have been shown to influence bird movements, entailing different movement behaviour of birds within a community. Studies investigating how both these factors influence the movements of entire bird assemblages across fragmented landscapes are essential but have rarely been conducted. In this study, we determined how species' traits and different forest matrices influence bird movements among nine forest patches in a highly fragmented South African landscape. We combined 90h of bird observations with capture-mark-recaptures (104754 mist-net hours) to distinguish between movements among patches (all birds that conduct long-distance movements across the landscape) and movements within patches (all resident birds that conduct only short-distance movements within a fragment). Overall, we detected a high bird movement activity across the fragmented landscape. Dietary specialization, habitat affinity and body mass strongly shaped the relative distribution of bird species across the nine fragments with frugivorous birds, forest specialists and large-bodied species showing the highest movement abilities. In contrast, resident insectivores and forest generalists tended to move only within particular forest fragments. Our results suggest that remnant forest fragments may represent valuable stepping stones as well as permanent habitat for local bird assemblages. We emphasize that beside the conservation of natural forests, the maintenance of nearby, structurally rich forest fragments is pivotal in maintaining regional forest bird assemblages in human-modified landscapes. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - The persistence of wildlife in fragmented landscapes is predicted to rely on the presence of critical habitat elements. In urban landscapes, the persistence of hollow-dependent bats arguably depends upon the protection of roosting habitat, yet knowledge of bat roosting requirements within these landscapes is limited. We used radiotelemetry to locate day roosts of a species considered sensitive to urbanization, Gould's long-eared bat (Nyctophilus gouldi), in suburban bushland in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. We compared roost selection data collected for 9 individuals during the mating season (March-April 2009) and 10 individuals during the maternity season (November-December 2009). We found 41 roosts of N. gouldi under decorticating bark and in tree hollows, which were all located in 1 suburban bushland reserve (∼40 ha), with roosts rarely located elsewhere, despite the abundance of available trees in smaller patches outside of the reserve. N. gouldi displayed a clear preference for trees with a greater amount of understory and canopy cover, and only roosted where the extent of forest cover in the local landscape was greatest. Maternity roosts also were predominately located in gullies, and closer to creek lines than expected. Roost switching differed significantly between seasons, with lactating females switching roosts significantly more often than nonlactating females, where roost switching occurred after 1 day on 71% of occasions. Because competition with other fauna for hollows has been suggested as a potential threat, systematic observations of hollow-using bird species, including rainbow lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus), were conducted. We observed birds occupying bat roosts on days following bat occupancy, and bats roosted in trees where there were fewer hollow-using birds than randomly available trees. We recommend that further examination of hollow competition be undertaken because abundant, urban-adapted, hollow-nesting birds may render hollows a limiting resource to hollow-users such as bats in urban landscapes. Protection of a network of potential roost trees in suburban bushland remnants, particularly along creek lines, will assist in maintaining this critical resource for bats. © 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - This survey of one the longest insect conservation campaigns in Australia deals with recovery of one of the most iconic endemic butterflies, the Richmond birdwing, threatened by clearance and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest in eastern Australia and the spread of an alien larval food-plant. Its conservation has involved many aspects of community involvement, developed over more than 20 years, and focused on habitat restoration and weed eradication, in conjunction with conservation of remaining forest fragments. The work has involved the entire historical range of the butterfly, addressed threats and emphasised landscape connectivity, and has enhanced recovery through extensive plantings of native food plants. Interest has been maintained through extensive publicity, community education and media activity, and the programme has provided many lessons for advancing insect conservation practice in the region. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Of all feeding guilds, understorey insectivores are thought to be most sensitive to disturbance and forest conversion. We compared the composition of bird feeding guilds in tropical forest fragments with adjacent agro-ecosystems in a montane region of south-west Ethiopia. We used a series of point counts to survey birds in 19 agriculture and 19 forest sites and recorded tree species within each farm across an area of 40 × 35 km. Insectivores (∼17 spp. per plot), frugivores (∼3 spp. per plot) and omnivores (∼5 spp. per plot) maintained species density across habitats, while granivores and nectarivores increased in the agricultural sites by factors of 7 and 3 respectively. Species accumulation curves of each guild were equal or steeper in agriculture, suggesting that agricultural and forest landscapes were equally heterogeneous for all bird guilds. Counter to most published studies, we found no decline in insectivore species richness with forest conversion. However, species composition differed between the two habitats, with certain forest specialists replaced by other species within each feeding guild. We suggest that the lack of difference in insectivorous species numbers between forest and agriculture in this region is due to the benign nature of the agricultural habitat, but also due to a regional species pool which contains many bird species which are adapted to open habitats.

AB  - One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations. © 2013 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - Tropical forests support high levels of avian diversity but these areas have been impacted by extensive deforestation. The lowland tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna in southwest China is one such impacted hotspot. In this region, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations have replaced most of the original forest, but numerous small fragments of forest remain. To assess the value of these fragments to avian diversity, we classified the fifteen selected remnant forest patches into three size categories, <1. ha, 1-3. ha, and 3-6. ha, and conducted avifauna surveys. We found that 97 bird species inhabit the fragments and that bird diversity increases with patch area. The resident species composition similarity index was low among forest patches, both within and across size categories, and also low between the wet and dry seasons. Ground insectivores, frugivores and large bird species were the most vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Our study encouragingly shows that fragments can play an important role in bird conservation in regions that now lack large tracts of natural forest; however, current patches are too small to support stable annual populations of some species, while others are more tolerant of fragmentation. We discuss these findings and provide conservation strategies to improve bird conservation within rubber plantations in southern China. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Extinction has claimed half of all historically-known Hawaiian passerines, and today many extant species are increasingly threatened due to the combined effects of invasive species and climate change. Habitat disturbance has affected populations of feeding specialists most profoundly, and our results indicate that specialists continue to be most vulnerable, although even some abundant, introduced, generalist species also may be affected. Surveys of passerines during 1998-2011 in subalpine woodland habitat on Mauna Kea Volcano, Island of Hawai'i, revealed that the abundance of the critically endangered palila (Loxioides bailleui), a seed specialist, declined by 79% after 2003. The 'akiapōlā'au (Hemignathus munroi), an endangered specialist insectivore, was not detected in the survey area after 1998. The Hawai'i 'amakihi (Hemignathus virens virens), a generalist feeder and the most abundant species on Mauna Kea, was the only native species to maintain a stable population. The Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus), a well-entrenched generalist and one of the three most common introduced species, declined. Drought prevailed in 74% of months during 2000-2011, and dry conditions contributed to the recent decline of the palila by reducing the annual māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) seed pod crop, which influences palila breeding and survival. Sustained browsing by introduced ungulates also lowered habitat carrying capacity, and their elimination should reduce the effects of drought and promote forest restoration. Our results illustrate how the feeding ecology of a species can influence its response to interacting environmental perturbations, and they underscore the value of long-term monitoring to detect population trends of sensitive species. © 2012.

AB  - Mistletoes are a functional category of plants, defined as shrubby, aerial hemiparasites which depend on their host plants for water and mineral nutrition. Although three aberrant species (all in monotypic genera) are root parasitic, mistletoes are stem parasites, attaching to their hosts via specialized organs called haustoria. Mistletoes belong to the order Santalales and are arranged in the families Loranthaceae, Viscaceae, Misodendraceae, and Santalaceae, with the great majority of species belonging to the first two families (Nickrent et al. 2010). Although some species regularly parasitize lianas and other mistletoes, most species are dependent on trees and shrubs as principal hosts. The more than 1,500 species worldwide live in diverse habitats from rainforest to semiarid woodlands and are absent only from habitats devoid of woody hosts (e.g., polar, alpine and desert environments). Mistletoes are an important food source and nesting site for many birds and mammals (Watson 2001; Cooney et al. 2006; Mathiasen et al. 2008) and have a positive effect on the diversity and distribution of vertebrate animals in a range of habitats (Mathiasen et al. 2008; Watson 2002). By comparison, the ecological interactions between mistletoes and invertebrates—particularly arthropods—are poorly known. Unlike birds and mammals—long-lived and highly mobile animals that visit mistletoes periodically—many insects live their entire lives within mistletoe clumps, completely dependent on them for food and shelter. In this contribution, we summarize recent research on mistletoe-dependent arthropods, contrasting the extreme specialism exhibited by herbivorous groups, with lower substrate specificity (and greater dependence on structural complexity) displayed by predatory taxa. Rather than simply a subset of the biota found in the host canopy, we demonstrate that arthropods in mistletoes represent discrete and complementary assemblages, hitherto overlooked islands within a sea of forest and woodland treetops. Finally, we consider these findings in terms of the threats facing many forested systems, demonstrating the utility of mistletoe-dependent arthropods as sensitive indicators of overall forest health and ecosystem integrity. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Fragmentation of natural habitats is a central concern of biodiversity conservation and is considered a significant factor contributing to species loss and populations decline. We studied this in Cotové Agricultural Center in the municipality of Santa Fe de Antioquia (Colombia),where the conversion of natural forests to different land use systems, has limited the amount of available habitat. With the aim to describe the effect of habitat loss on bird presence in five land uses (fruiting trees, silvopastoral systems, secondary forest, pasture low density of trees and grass cutting) in this area, we studied bird diversity using two methods: fixed point counts and mist nets to analyze the influence of land use in the composition, richness and abundance of birds present were studied. A total of 6 633 individuals of 101 species were observed of which 11 species were migratory. The insectivorous and frugivorous foraging guilds were better represented. The Shannon index indicated the highest values of alpha diversity for the silvopastoral system, and the fruit with the lowest. The grazing and silvopastoral land systems shared more species with low tree density. The importance of the environmental heterogeneity found is highlighted as a positive factor for bird species richness, mostly of low and middle habitat specificity, and preferably from edge habitats and open areas. In order to preserve natural regeneration and connectivity between different land use types, and to promote stability of bird species populations, some management actions should be implemented in the area.

AB  - Honeydew foraging by birds has been extensively documented in recent years. However, this interaction has been poorly documented in Brazil, with predominance of few species of birds foraging only in Mimosa scabrella trees. With the objective of describing the behavior of birds interacting with scale insects associated with trees, we conducted a study at the Serra de São José, Tiradentes, in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Observations were recorded from June to July 2012. We observed 13 species of birds feeding on honeydew scale insects, eight never previously recorded. We observed individuals using aerial and surface maneuvers to collect the honeydew on the branches or reaching the droppings below the branches. These species were observed foraging individually, in pairs and also in large groups. Our results suggest that honeydew excretion from scale insects associated with Pseudopiptadenia leptostachya trees represents an important energy source for local birds as observed in fragments of Atlantic Forest in the Minas Gerais State, southeast region of Brazil.

AB  - Culicoides vectors can transmit a diverse array of parasites and are globally distributed. We studied feeding preferences and seasonal variation of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) vectors in an urban forest of Germany to determine whether humans living nearby are readily exposed to vector-borne parasites from wild animals. We used a fragment of the mtDNA COI gene to identify hosts from blood meals. We amplified a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b to detect haemosporidian infections in Culicoides abdomens and thoraxes. We detected a total of 22 Culicoides species. Fifty-eight blood meals (84%) were from humans, 10 from birds, and one from livestock. We found Culicoides kibunensis (considered ornithophilic) with 29 human blood meals. Host generalist Culicoides festivipennis and Culicoides obsoletus had 14 human blood meals. Culicoides clastrieri and Culicoides semimaculatus fed on birds; previously humans were their only known host. Six thoraxes and three abdomens were infected with either Haemoproteus pallidulus or Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi. There were changes in Culicoides community structure across months. Culicoides pictipennis was the dominant species during spring, C. kibunensis and C. clastrieri were dominant during summer, and C. obsoletus was dominant by early autumn. All dominant species were generalists feeding on birds, livestock and humans. Our results indicate that humans can serve as a blood source for dominant Culicoides species instead of the normal wild animal hosts in urban areas. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Amazonia now contains vast areas of secondary forest because of widespread regeneration following timber harvests, yet the value of secondary forest to wildlife remains poorly understood. Secondary forest becomes structurally similar to primary forest after abandonment, and therefore we predicted that avian movement across the interface of primary and secondary forest (hereafter "the interface") would gradually increase with time since abandonment until recovery to pre-isolation levels. From 1992 to 2011, we captured 2,773 understory birds of 10 foraging guilds along the interface of primary forest fragments and zero- to 30-year-old secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. Our objectives were to understand the differences in land-use history that affect cross-interface movement and to determine how long it takes each guild to recover to pre-isolation capture rates. Across guilds, age of secondary forest within 100 m of the interface was the most important explanatory variable affecting capture rates; rates increased with age of secondary forest for all guilds except non-forest species. Mean recovery to pre-isolation was 26 years (asymmetric SE = 13 years below and 16 years above estimate) after secondary forest abandonment and 9 of 10 guilds recovered within 13 to 34 years. In the slowest guild to recover, terrestrial insectivores, 6 of 12 species were never caught along the interface, and we projected that this guild would recover in ∼60 years. Our recovery estimates quantify the dynamic permeability of the interface and contribute to a better understanding of the value of secondary forests as corridors among primary forest fragments.

AB  - Across the Neotropics, small-bodied terrestrial insectivores are sensitive to forest fragmentation and are largely absent from second-growth forests. Despite their sensitivity to forest structure, the microhabitat relationships of these birds have not been quantified. From July 1994 to January 1995 in central Amazonia, we characterized habitat at sites where nine species of terrestrial insectivores were observed foraging, as well as at randomly selected sites in continuous forest and two types of 10-15-yr-old second-growth forest common in Amazonia (Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated). We used factor analysis to find suites of correlated variables. From each factor, we selected a representative variable that was relatively easy to measure. We used Bayesian analysis to estimate means and standard deviations of these variables for each species and for each type of habitat. All nine focal species were associated with ranges of microhabitat variables, such as leaf litter depth and tree densities, often absent in second-growth forests. At least in the early stages of regeneration, neither type of second-growth forest provides suitable structure for the terrestrial insectivores in our study. The large leaves of Cecropia trees that make up the thick leaf litter may preclude the use of Cecropia-dominated second growth by our focal species, many of which manipulate leaves when foraging. The leaf litter in Vismia-dominated second growth was also thicker than sites used for foraging by our focal species. In addition, Vismia-dominated growth had more small trees and small nonwoody vegetation, perhaps impeding movement by terrestrial birds. In continuous forest, our focal species foraged in microhabitats with characteristics that generally overlapped those of randomly selected sites. Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that microhabitat differences make second-growth forests unsuitable for our focal species. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The conversion of forest into farmland has resulted in mosaic landscapes in many parts of the tropics. From a conservation perspective, it is important to know whether tropical farmlands can buffer species loss caused by deforestation and how different functional groups of birds respond to land-use intensification. To test the degree of differentiation between farmland and forest bird communities across feeding guilds, we analyzed stable C and N isotopes in blood and claws of 101 bird species comprising four feeding guilds along a tropical forest-farmland gradient in Kenya. We additionally assessed the importance of farmland insectivores for pest control in C4 crops by using allometric relationships, C stable isotope ratios and estimates of bird species abundance. Species composition differed strongly between forest and farmland bird communities. Across seasons, forest birds primarily relied on C3 carbon sources, whereas many farmland birds also assimilated C4 carbon. While C sources of frugivores and omnivores did not differ between forest and farmland communities, insectivores used more C4 carbon in the farmland than in the forest. Granivores assimilated more C4 carbon than all other guilds in the farmland. We estimated that insectivorous farmland birds consumed at least 1,000 kg pest invertebrates km-2 year-1. We conclude that tropical forest and farmland understory bird communities are strongly separated and that tropical farmlands cannot compensate forest loss for insectivorous forest understory birds. In tropical farmlands, insectivorous bird species provide a quantitatively important contribution to pest control. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Tropical deforestation continues to cause population declines and local extinctions in centers of avian diversity and endemism. Although local species extinctions stem from reductions in demographic rates, little is known about how habitat fragmentation influences survival of tropical bird populations or the relative importance of survival and fecundity in ultimately shaping communities. We analyzed 22 years of mark-recapture data to assess how fragmentation influenced apparent survival, recruitment, and realized population growth rate within 22 forest understory bird species in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. This represents the first such effort, in either tropical or temperate systems, to characterize the effect of deforestation on avian survival across such a broad suite of species. Long-term demographic analysis of this suite of species experiencing the same fragmented environment revealed considerable variability in species' responses to fragmentation, in addition to general patterns that emerged from comparison among species. Across the understory bird community as a whole, we found significantly lower apparent survival and realized population growth rate in small fragments relative to large, demonstrating fragmentation effects to demographic rates long after habitat loss. Demographic rates were depressed across five feeding guilds, suggesting that fragmentation sensitivity was not limited to insectivores. Seniority analyses, together with a positive effect of fragmentation on recruitment, indicated that depressed apparent survival was the primary driver of population declines and observed extinctions. We also found a landscape effect, with lower vital rates in one mountain range relative to another, suggesting that fragmentation effects may add to other large-scale drivers of population decline. Overall, realized population growth rate (λ) estimates were <1 for most species, suggesting that future population persistence, even within large forest fragments, is uncertain in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Disentangling the confounded effects of edge and area in fragmented landscapes is a recurrent challenge for landscape ecologists, requiring the use of appropriate study designs. Here, we examined the effects of forest fragment area and plot location at forest edges versus interiors on native and exotic bird assemblages on Banks Peninsula (South Island, New Zealand). We also experimentally measured with plasticine models how forest fragment area and edge versus interior location influenced the intensity of avian insectivory. Bird assemblages were sampled by conducting 15 min point-counts at paired edge and interior plots in 13 forest fragments of increasing size (0.5-141 ha). Avian insectivory was measured as the rate of insectivorous bird attacks on plasticine models mimicking larvae of a native polyphagous moth. We found significant effects of edge, but not of forest patch area, on species richness, abundance and composition of bird assemblages. Exotic birds were more abundant at forest edges, while neither edge nor area effects were noticeable for native bird richness and abundance. Model predation rates increased with forest fragmentation, both because of higher insectivory in smaller forest patches and at forest edges. Avian predation significantly increased with insectivorous bird richness and foraging bird abundance. We suggest that the coexistence of native and exotic birds in New Zealand mosaic landscapes enhances functional diversity and trait complementation within predatory bird assemblages. This coexistence results in increased avian insectivory in small forest fragments through additive edge and area effects. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The effects of forest fragmentation on ecological interactions and particularly on food webs have scarcely been analysed. There is usually less herbivory in forest fragments than in continuous forests. Here we hypothesize that forest fragmentation enhances top-down control of herbivory through an increase in insectivorous birds and a decrease in herbivorous insects, with a consequent decrease in plant reproductive success in small forest fragments. In the Maulino forest in central Chile, we experimentally excluded birds from Aristotelia chilensis (Elaeocarpaceae) trees in both forest fragments and continuous forest, and analysed herbivore insect abundance, herbivory and plant reproductive success during two consecutive growing seasons. We expected that insect abundance and herbivory would increase, and reproductive success would decrease in A.chilensis from which birds have been excluded, particularly in forest fragments where bird abundance and predation pressure on insects is higher. The abundance of herbivorous insects was lower in the forest fragments than in the continuous forest only in the first season, and herbivory was lower in forest fragments than in the continuous forest throughout the study. Moreover, during the second growing season herbivory was greater in the excluded trees than in the control trees, and as expected, there was a greater difference in the fragments than in the continuous forest, but this was not statistically significant. Exclusion of birds did not affect the reproductive success of A.chilensis. Our results, after 2years of study, demonstrate that birds affect the levels of herbivory on A.chilensis in the Maulino forest, but do not support our hypothesis of enhanced top-down control in fragmented forests, as the strength of the effect of excluding birds did not vary with fragmentation. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - The Yellow-olive Flatbill (Tolmomyias sulphurescens) is a small insectivorous passerine inhabiting Neotropic forests. Its breeding biology is poorly known despite its abundance and conspicuousness. We describe the nesting biology of Yellow-olive Flatbills from Atlantic Forest fragments in Belo Horizonte County, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Eighty nests were monitored every 3-5 days from August to January between 1995 and 2000. Active nests were found from mid-September through late December with a peak from mid October through late November. First clutches were usually laid during the first rains, but prior to the main peak in annual rainfall. The Yellow-olive Flatbill builds closed, pencile nests on tree branches along streams or roads, principally of dark fungal (Marasmius sp.) fibers. Clutch size ranged from two to four white eggs. Incubation was irregular and hatching was asynchronous. Incubation and nestling periods were 20 and 23 days, respectively. Nesting success across all 5 years was 29 (mean among years = 31%, CI = 25-37%), and nest predation was the main cause of nest failure (49%). Mayfield estimates of nest survival were low (mean 26%, CI = 17-36%), and the probability of an egg to produce a fledgling was only 10%. Fledging success was 0.8 fledglings per breeding pair, and chicks fledged at 107% (CI = 106-108) of mean adult body mass. Our results do not support the purported pattern of long breeding seasons for tropical birds. The Yellow-olive Flatbill laid unusually large clutches, had lower nest survival, and greater fledgling productivity compared with other tropical passerines. © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - We studied species, functional groups, and habitat preferences of birds in five classes of agroforestry systems: agroforests, animal agroforestry, linear agroforestry, sequential agroforestry, and crops under tree cover in Tabasco, Mexico. Sampling sites were >2 km from natural forest fragments. Observations were made at 38 sites using 30-min point and transect counts in the morning and afternoon in the rainy season, season of northern winds, and dry season from June 2008 to May 2009. We observed 3,551 birds, which were assigned to 102 species: 72 were resident and 30 were migratory species. Overall efficiency of sampling was 82.4% and varied from 68.7% in linear agroforestry to 81.5% in animal agroforestry. Total species richness varied from 43 in sequential agroforestry to 64 in animal agroforestry. Species richness and Shannon diversity indices revealed no differences among agroforestry classes. Bird communities in animal agroforestry, linear agroforestry, and sequential agroforestry had similar species compositions, as did agroforests and crops under tree cover. Birds in all agroforestry classes were mainly forest generalists, although specialists of open areas were common, particularly in animal and sequential agroforestry. Only one individual of a forest specialist species was observed during sampling. Migrant species were mostly forest generalists, but some open area specialists occurred in animal agroforestry. Resident birds were distributed over all foraging guilds in all agroforestry classes, whereas migrants were mainly foliage-gleaning insectivores. Foraging guilds had different relative abundances among agroforestry classes. Structural diversity of agroforestry classes did not seem to influence bird species richness. Forest specialist species were virtually absent in agroforestry classes, but the avifauna in agroforestry is diverse and valuable in itself. © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - We studied five populations of a rainforest understory insectivorous bird (Myrmeciza exsul, chestnut-backed antbird) in a fragmented landscape in northeastern Costa Rica in order to test hypotheses about the influence of forest fragmentation on population genetic structure using 16 microsatellite loci. Bayesian assignment approaches-perhaps the most conservative analyses we performed-consistently grouped the sites into two distinct groups, with all individuals from the smallest and most isolated population clustering separately from the other four sites. Additional analyses revealed (1) overall significant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differentiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and (3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by elevated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites. Our results are somewhat surprising given the small geographic distances between sites (11-34 km) and the short time (~60 years) since wide-spread deforestation in this landscape. We suspect fine-scale genetic structure may occur in many resident tropical bird species, and in the case of the chestnut-backed antbird it appears that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has important population genetic implications. It appears that chestnut-backed antbirds may persist in fragmented landscapes in the absence of significant migration among patches, but mechanisms that allow this species to persist when many other similar species do not are not well understood. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Although predation is generally seen as one of the key factors determining the abundance and composition of insect herbivore communities in tropical rain forests, quantitative estimates of predation pressure in rain-forest habitats remain rare. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies on semi-concealed and exposed caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in lowland and montane tropical rain forests, using plasticine models of caterpillars. We recorded attacks on caterpillars in four habitats: primary forest, secondary forest and forest fragment in lowlands (200 m asl), and montane primary forest (1700 m asl). We used 300 exposed and 300 semi-concealed caterpillars daily, and conducted the experiment for 6 d in every habitat. Daily incidence of attacks was higher on exposed caterpillars (4.95%) than on semi-concealed (leaf-rolling) caterpillars (2.99%). Attack pressure of natural enemies differed also among habitats. In the lowlands, continuous primary and secondary forests had similar daily incidence of attacks (2.39% and 2.36%) which was however lower than that found in a primary forest fragment (4.62%). This difference was caused by higher incidence of attacks by birds, ants and wasps in the forest fragment. The most important predators were birds in montane rain forests (61.9% of identified attacks), but insect predators, mostly ants, in the lowlands (58.3% of identified attacks). These results suggest that rapid decrease in the abundance of ants with altitude may be compensated by increased importance of birds as predators in montane forests. Further, it suggests that small rain-forest fragments may suffer from disproportionately high pressure from natural enemies, with potentially serious consequences for survival of their herbivorous communities.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is an important ecological determinant of species richness. We evaluated the diversity within bird feeding guilds as related to habitat heterogeneity and land-use cover in a human-modified tropical landscape. To quantify this process, fine-scale bird census and habitat heterogeneity data were collected for a bird community in a 22.5-km2 fragmented landscape in southern Mexico. Land-use cover data derived from field surveys were used to calculate habitat heterogeneity index values and the extent of each land-use cover type in 239 grid cells of 300 × 300 m. Bird diversity values were obtained based on 1195 point-counts in these cells. Product-moment correlations and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between bird-guild diversity values and habitat heterogeneity. A total of 109 resident bird species grouped in six feeding guilds were recorded: insectivores (42%), frugivores (21%), granivores (17%), nectarivores (9%), omnivores (8%) and carnivores (3%). Diversity values for the entire bird community were significantly positively related to habitat heterogeneity, but feeding guilds showed contrasting responses to habitat heterogeneity and the amount of land-use cover: insectivores and frugivores were more diverse and abundant in secondary forests than in any other land-cover. Our findings illustrate the importance of small landscape fragments as potential key refuges for the most diverse and specialized feeding guilds, such as granivores and insectivores.

AB  - Habitat isolation is expected to reduce population densities of animals via reduced immigration. However, altered trophic interactions in isolated habitats may modify these effects, especially since the strength of isolation effects is expected to increase with trophic rank. Here, we studied effects of habitat isolation on a food-web module consisting of herbivorous beetles, predatory spiders, spider-preying wasps and arthropod-feeding birds. We compare two systems that were studied in subsequent years: a study on 29 mature apple orchards that varied in the degree of isolation from forest, and a study on 20 groups of newly planted cherry trees that showed similar variation in their degree of habitat isolation. No birds were observed on the young fruit trees. Wasps and spiders showed the expected lower abundances in isolated habitats. On mature trees, birds were present and showed lower abundances in isolated habitats. Wasps were reduced to a similar degree by habitat isolation as on the young trees. Surprisingly, spider densities on the mature trees were higher in isolated than in connected habitat. This contrasting response of spiders to habitat isolation is likely to be due to release from bird predation in isolated mature orchards. In both study systems, beetles showed no significant effect of habitat isolation. Our results confirm that the sensitivity to fragmentation increases with trophic rank, and suggest that trophic interactions should receive more attention in fragmentation studies.

AB  - Traditional approaches to the study of species persistence in fragmented landscapes generally consider a binary classification of habitat being suitable or unsuitable; however, the range of human-modified habitats within a region may offer a gradient of habitat suitability (or conservation value) for species. We identified such a gradient by comparing bird assemblages among contrasting land uses (pine plantations of different age, annual crops, clear cuts and cattle pastures) in the Upper Parana Atlantic forest. Bird assemblages and vegetation structure were characterized in an extensive area of 4400 km 2 in Argentina and Paraguay during the breeding seasons of 2005-2010. Similarity of bird assemblages between anthropogenic habitats and the native forest and the proportion of forest species increased with vegetation vertical structure, while the proportion of open-area species decreased. As a consequence, mature tree plantations were the most suitable habitats for forest species and were mainly used by frugivores and bark insectivores. In contrast, open habitats were the least suitable habitat for forest species and were used primarily by insectivores. Human-created habitats that are structurally complex can be used by a subset of forest species, and may improve functional connectivity and mitigate edge effects. The conservation of large tracks of native forests, however, is critical for the long-term persistence of the entire bird assemblage, especially for native forest dependent species. © 2011 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - The consequences of habitat alteration on the role of understory insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects in tropical forests are poorly understood. To examine whether fragmentation may affect the top-down controls of herbivory, we compared the number of species, individuals, and the community structure of insectivorous birds between fragments and continuous tropical moist forest in Mexico. We also registered insect herbivore abundances and conducted a larvae predation experiment to evaluate the potential role of insectivorous birds as predators of herbivorous insects. We recorded 63 bird species from 22 families, 43 percent of which were insectivorous birds. Species richness, abundance, and diversity of the avian community were higher in continuous forest compared with forest fragments. For insectivorous birds in particular, there was low similarity in avian insectivore communities between forest types, and forest fragments had more heavily dominated communities of avian insectivores. During the dry season, forest fragments presented significantly higher predation rates on artificial caterpillars, and lower abundance of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae, compared with continuous forest. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between artificial caterpillar predation rate and larval Lepidoptera abundance, with higher rates of predation in sample sites of low Lepidoptera abundance. Hence, the potentially greater light in the dry season combined with a more dominated avian insectivore community in forest fragments may facilitate increased predation by avian insectivores, resulting in a decline in abundance of larval Lepidoptera, with implications for the process of insect-driven herbivory in forest fragments. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - In Madagascar, despite acute land use pressure on forests coupled with unprecedented loss of endemic species and natural habitats, data on species distributions outside natural habitats are strikingly scarce. In this study, this gap is addressed by measuring bird diversity both within a protected forest corridor, and in the agricultural mosaic surrounding it. Results show that the diversity of all birds, and also of several functional guilds was higher in the mosaic than in the corridor. Moreover, 69% of all species found in the forest (61% of those classified as forest species) also occupied the agricultural mosaic. The diversity of frugivores, canopy insectivores and forest species in the mosaic was highly dependent upon the variety of scattered trees, small forest patches, plantations and secondary habitats distributed throughout the landscape. Generalist frugivores were particularly abundant in the mosaic, implying high potential for the maintenance of seed dispersal and fallow regeneration ecosystem services. Forest species in the mosaic were more generalist and less abundant, however, than those in the forest, suggesting the presence of both source-sink dynamics and potential biotic homogenization of the community in this landscape. Although under current conditions of heterogeneity and composition, the agricultural mosaic harbors a significant proportion of the endemic bird community, this study confirms the need for both sustained protection of large forest areas, and for adequate management of the agricultural landscape, particularly through the maintenance and enhancement of old-growth and isolated tree structures and fragments. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changing environmental conditions and human encroachment on natural habitats bring human populations closer to novel sources of parasites, which might then develop into new emerging diseases. Diseases transmitted by host generalist vectors are of special interest due to their capacity to move pathogens into novel hosts. We hypothesize that humans using forests for recreation are exposed to a broad range of parasites from wild animals and their vectors. A corollary of this is that new vector-host, parasite-host, and vector-parasite associations could eventually develop. Thus, we expect to observe atypical vector-host associations. Using molecular bloodmeal analysis via amplification of the mtDNA COI gene we identified the vertebrate hosts of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species in a sub-urban forest of Southwestern Germany. Bloodmeals were also checked for haemosporidian infections by amplifying a fragment of the mtDNA cyt b gene. We identified a total of 20 Culicoides species, thirteen of which fed on humans. From 105 screened bloodmeals we obtained high quality sequences for 77 samples, 73 (94.8%) originated from humans, two from livestock (Bos taurus and Equus caballus), and two from wild birds (Sylvia atricapilla and Turdus merula). We found that four Culicoides species previously assumed to feed exclusively on either birds (C. kibunensis) or domestic mammals (C. chiopterus, C. deltus, C. scoticus) fed also on humans. A total of six Culicoides abdomens were infected with avian haemosporidian parasites (Plasmodium or Haemoproteus), four of those abdomens contained blood derived from humans. Our results suggest that parasites of wild animals may be transferred to humans through infectious bites of Culicoides vectors. Further, we show that Culicoides vectors believed to be a specialist on specific vertebrate groups can have plastic feeding preferences, and that Culicoides are susceptible to infection by Plasmodium parasites, though vector viability must still be experimentally demonstrated. © 2012 Santiago-Alarcon et al.

AB  - Riparian zones of watercourses contribute to the conservation of birds, since they are used as ecological corridors for moving between forests by many species. The disturbance of these areas impacts negatively the species diversity of the regions. This study reports on the richness, abundance and feeding guilds of birds in different widths of riparian forest along watercourses, in Caí River Hydrographic Basin, Rio Grande do Sul. Eighteen fixed points of observation were randomized, at least 200 meters apart from each other, classified into three treatments of riparian forest width. Four observations were conducted at each point between January and May in 2009. The richness of bird species did not vary significantly between treatments, but we noticed that the composition varied according to the characteristics of each area, and a total of 97 species were identified. We recorded the presence of Limnoctites rectirostris, which is listed as an endangered species. Abundance, with 785 individuals, varied between treatments, with greater abundance of generalist species, which easily find resources in most environments, such as insectivorous birds, in areas with smaller riparian forest. We note that the fragmentation of riparian forest affects the ability to suit the needs of bioindicator birds because they use these environments for feeding, breeding and resting, and as ecological corridors. Thus, the restoration and preservation of riparian forests with a minimum coverage of 30 meters of the original vegetation are essential for bird species that indicate good environmental quality. © 2012 by Unisinos.

AB  - Population monitoring is a vital tool for conservation management and for testing hypotheses about population trends in changing environments. Darwin's finches on Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos archipelago have experienced habitat alteration because of human activity, introduced predators, parasites and disease. We used point counts to conduct systematic quantitative surveys of Darwin's finches and other land birds between 1997 and 2010. The temporal analysis revealed that six of the nine species investigated declined significantly and that this decline was most pronounced at higher elevations in humid native forest and agricultural areas; the highland areas have been most affected by introduced species or direct human impact. Five of the six declining species are insectivorous, which suggests that changes in insect abundance or insect availability are a critical factor in the declines. Further study is required to test this idea. Other factors including habitat alteration and introduced parasites or pathogens may be contributing to the observed declines. © 2012 Fauna & Flora Internationa.

AB  - Mangroves have been studied extensively but still remain poorly understood for their eco-biology. The mangroves are quite old, arising some 60 million years ago. Currently the global mangrove coverage is about 15.2 million hectares in 124 countries, and restricted to the latitudes between 30°N and 30°S. There are three major types of mangroves: river-dominated; tide-dominated; and, interior swamp; influenced by tidal and river waters. The mangroves occur in low-lying, broad coastal plains where the topographic gradients are small and the tidal amplitude large. They find it difficult to colonize the coastal zone with waves of high energy and hence they normally establish themselves in sheltered shorelines. The ecological factors that strongly influence the mangroves are wave action, rainfall, freshwater runoff, erosion/sedimentation rates, aridity, salinity, nutrient inputs, and soil quality. The mangroves are not a single genetic group but representing a large variety of plant families (20) and species (71) adapted to tropical inter-tidal environment. Mangrove taxonomy needs much attention. Several species are poorly identified. There are several natural hybrids, but their parental species are not clearly understood. Another problem in the taxonomy of mangroves is the confusion between the species of "true mangroves" and mangrove associates. Often the same species is named differently at different sites. Molecular analyses may eventually help resolve the taxonomic problems. There are mangrove species endemic to certain places. Discontinuous distribution of mangrove species is also of interest. Asia region is rich in mangrove biodiversity with 55 species and it also has the largest extent of mangrove coverage (38.5% of total). Globally two species are critically endangered, three endangered and six are at vulnerable status and these species pose problems of slow growth and low seed viability. Two species, Sonneratia griffithii and Heritiera fomes exhibited high global loss that ranged from 50-80%. Such an assessment of conservation status of the mangrove species in different countries assumes great importance. In India, 67% of mangrove plants, 52% of macroalgae, 10% of invertebrates and 4% of vertebrates associated with mangrove systems are at threat. However, a methodology exclusively for assessing conservation status of mangrove species is yet to be perfected. Mangroves are unique to have genes for betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase and several antioxidative enzymes which play role in stress tolerance of mangrove species. The mangroves display high genetic diversity as a result from genotype differences, or from phenotypic responses to local environments. The molecular markers used to study genetic variability in mangroves are (i) allozymes, (ii) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), (iii) random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), (iv) amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), (v) microsatellites (SSR), (vi) Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), and (vii) DNA sequence. Mangroves are able to adapt to themselves to practically all types of adverse conditions except frost, and hence they are distributed mostly in the tropical regions. Probably there are no other groups of woody plants in the entire plant kingdom with such highly developed adaptations. These adaptations vary among mangrove species and with physicochemical nature of their habitats. The mangroves have exposed breathing roots, extensive support roots, salt-excreting leaves, and viviparous water-dispersed propagules. The mangroves have xerophytic and hydrophytic characters in leaves and roots respectively. The aerial parts of the mangroves are equipped with lenticels helping in gas exchange, and they are also rich in phenolic compounds which confer protection against pest and parasites. The mangroves are adapted to salinity based on any of the three mechanisms: (i) salt exclusion; (ii) salt excretion; and, (iii) salt accumulation. The salt regulation at the cellular level is a remarkable adaptation in maintaining osmobalance between cytoplasm (occupying 20% of cell volume) and cell vacuole (covering 80% of cell volume). Mangroves reproduce mostly sexually by flowers. The flowers produce large numbers of pollen grains (around 5-7 lakhs per flower of Rhizophora), but stigma receptivity lasts for a short period, at which pollination should take place. Pollination is by both self and cross mechanisms. The latter is facilitated by wind, insects and birds and in some instances bats. The fertilized flowers may set fruits. Sprouting of propagules may be of different types: vivipary, cryptovivipary, and normal germination on soil. The viviparity allows seedlings to develop salinity tolerance and efficiency in nutrient storage, while attached with the mother plant. The survival and growth of the propagules from mangroves are strongly influence by physicochemical factors. Much of the ecological service of mangroves lies in protecting the coast from solar UV-B radiation, =green house' effects, and fury of cyclones, floods, sea-level rise, wave action and coastal erosion. The root systems of the plants keep the substrate firm, and thus contribute to a lasting stability of the coast. Mangrove swamps act as traps for the sediments, and recycling of nutrients through microbial decomposition processes. The mangroves provide a source of food, breeding grounds and nurseries for many fishes, shellfishes, and other kinds of wildlife such as reptiles, birds and mammals. They further help in offering protection to other associated flora and fauna of the coastal ecosystems and in contributing to complex food webs and energy transfers in the coastal and marine ecosystems. Mangrove forests are extremely important coastal resources, providing forestry products (firewood, charcoal, timber, honey etc.) and fishery products (fish, prawn, crab, mollusk etc.). The mangroves also contain rich sources of novel chemicals with biological activities and bioprospecting potential for development useful products like drugs. Mangroves may be further developed as sources of highly valued commercial products and fishery resources and also as sites for developing a burgeoning eco-tourism, if the mangroves are sustainably managed. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Stigmacoccus garmilleri Foldi (Hemiptera: Margarodidae) is an ecologically important honeydew-producing scale insect associated with oak trees (Quercus spp.) in highland forests of Veracruz, Mexico. The honeydew exudates of S. garmilleri serve as a significant nutrient source to many species of birds, insects, and sooty molds. Oak trees found in the forest interior, forest edge, and those scattered in pasture areas support scale insect colonies, though the pattern of insect infestations on trees within these varying landscape types has not been elucidated. This study aims to describe the distribution of scale insect infestation and any distinctions in honeydew production based on tree location. Scale insect density, honeydew volume, and sugar concentration were surveyed throughout a continuous landscape that included both patches of forest and scattered pasture trees. In addition, the anal filament through which the honeydew drop is secreted was also measured and was experimentally removed to test and measure regrowth. Scale insect densities on tree trunks were greatest on pasture trees, while intermediate densities were found on trees at the forest edge, and low densities on interior forest trees, suggesting that trees in disturbed areas are more susceptible to scale insect infestation. Trees with small diameters at breast height had significantly higher insect densities than trees with medium to large diameters. Trunk aspect (North, South, East, and West) was not a significant determinant of scale insect density. In forested areas higher densities of scale insects were found at three meters height in comparison to lower heights. Sugar concentrations and drop volumes of honeydew in forest and pasture areas were not significantly different. However, scale-insect anal tubes/filaments were significantly longer in pasture than they were in forests. Sugar concentrations of honeydew appeared to be positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with relative humidity. Experiments indicated that anal filaments could grow approximately 4 mm every 24 hours, and average tube growth was significantly faster in pasture than in forest, suggesting that there may be a physiological effect on the insect due to landscape disturbance. The results obtained in this study describe the increases in scale insect infestation of trees with forest disturbance. The effect of these increased scale insect densities on the host tree physiology is still to be resolved.

AB  - Although it is clear that the farmlands neighbouring fragmented forests are utilized by some forest birds, it is not clear how birds in general respond to farmland habitat mosaic. An effort was made to determine how bird density and foraging assemblages were influenced by farm structural characteristics and distance from forest edge. Thirty farms up to a distance of 12km around Kakamega forest in western Kenya were studied. Farm structure entailed size, hedge volume, habitat heterogeneity, woody plant density, plant diversity and crop cover. Birds were surveyed using line transects and DISTANCE analyses and classified into six feeding guilds and three habitat associations. Size of farms increased away from the forest, as woody plant density, plant diversity, indigenous trees and subsistence crop cover declined. The most important farm structure variable was hedge volume, which enhanced bird species richness, richness of shrub-land bird species and insectivorous bird density (R=0.58, P<0.01). Bird density increased with tree density while indigenous trees were suitable for insectivores and nectarivores. There were very few forest bird encounters. Agricultural practices incorporating maintenance of hedges and sound selection of agroforestry trees can enhance conservation of birds on farmland, though, not significantly for forest species. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Patch size, isolation, and vegetation structure are expected to strongly affect species persistence in fragmented landscapes, particularly for those with <30% of native habitat remaining. Those influences should be modulated by species characteristics, resulting in complex relationships. In order to investigate how species, habitat structure and landscape factors are related and how they affected species persistence, we studied bird communities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. Patch size strongly affected species richness and population abundances. However, some functional groups were more affected than others, particularly endemic and understory insectivores, species that are near the limits of their geographical distribution, those using few forest types, and those with their center of abundance in high altitude tropical forests. The effect of vegetation structure was mainly at the species level, reflecting specific responses to habitat quality. The importance of landscape variables varies according to the species group. For the most affected ones, which usually have low dispersal capacity, patch size and quality were the most relevant factors, whereas patch isolation was associated with the richness of groups with more generalist species. This pattern is due to the limited structural connectivity in the study region, composed of low matrix permeability (e. g. pastures and sugar cane), which isolate the most affected species, making them more dependent on local factors. In such a fragmented landscape, the largest patches should be prioritized for conservation purposes, as they aggregate the most vulnerable species and present the highest alpha diversity. Landscape management, as such, should also reconnect large fragments through corridors or matrix improvements, promoting better conditions for long-term persistence of the most affected species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We attempt to identify the threat to flying beetles imposed by mist nets deployed for bird studies in an area of Mediterranean mosaic of evergreen scrub and deciduous forest in Italy. The present paper is the first attempt to identify the non-target species which die in these artificial traps. A large number of large scarab beetles was entangled in mist nets during a complete ringing session. The seasonal trend of beetle populations and their daily flight activity were also recorded. The results lead us to suggest that the populations of some threatened dung beetles can be impoverished at local level and represent a bycatch of mist net techniques, especially in early spring and at sunrise, when their swarming and reproductive activity is high. When summed with other factors affecting these beetles, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, this tool may represent a threat for vulnerable insect populations. Trapping effects may also represent a depletion of food resource for some insectivorous birds. For these reasons we recommend cooperative research between ornithologists and entomologists to fully study the bycatch effects of mist netting on flying insects and their effects on food availability for insectivorous birds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Peat swamp forest is a unique wetland ecosystem covering extensive areas in Southeast Asia that has received relatively little scientific attention and is now being lost at a rapid pace. This study examines the effects of anthropogenic degradation on bird communities in disturbed peat swamp forest habitats - namely, intact logged forest, a degraded forest fragment, and non-forest regrowth - in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Results show that species richness was significantly higher and species composition significantly different in intact logged forest in comparison to the degraded forest fragment and non-forested area. Nectarivore and tree foliage-gleaning insectivore abundance declined outside the intact forest, while the regrowth was dominated by the yellow vented bulbul, an open country insectivore-frugivore. Surveys reveal that large intact tracts of logged peat swamp forest can harbour threatened and near threatened bird species (36% of records) and thus play a role in their conservation, especially for a few habitat specialists. Given the extent of unmanaged degraded peatlands and continuing pressure to development them, urgent conservation actions are needed to rehabilitate and protect this ecosystem. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies on the impacts of forest fragmentation on understory insectivorous birds in the Neotropics have highlighted that even narrow linear clearings, such as roads, can affect the movements of this guild of birds. We used playback trials of territorial vocalizations to assess the movements of three understory insectivorous bird species across two unpaved roads bisecting Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho in southeast Brazil, located within one of the largest remaining continuous Atlantic Forests. Movement patterns varied among species. While Chamaeza campanisona never crossed these roads, Pyriglena leucoptera crossed them in almost 100 percent of tests. Although Conopophaga lineata exhibited a significantly lower number of crossings along cleared sites, it was eventually willing to traverse the roads, showing an intermediate pattern. Shaded areas with connected canopy did not improve birds' willingness to cross roads compared with areas where treecrowns were at least 3m apart. Similarly, birds' willingness to cross an 8-m wide road with limited traffic (six vehicles/wk) was not significantly greater than that of a 12-m wide road with more intense traffic (41 vehicles/d). Our findings suggest that the negative impact of roads on bird movement is an issue that should be addressed by managers of Atlantic Forest conservation units, especially as economic development results in pressure to pave and widen roads.

AB  - Our aim in this study was to survey birds in two forest fragments of caatinga (shrubby physiognomy), and to assess similarities in species compositions. The fragments, Serra do Mudo (SM) and Fazenda Pindorama (FP), are located in Porteiras, in the municipality of Altinho, State of Pernambuco. Identification was done by observation and recognition of bird vocalizations. Field work was performed between April and September 2007, comprising 4 visits. In a sampling effort of 100 h, we recorded 138 species, distributed among 44 families: SM (112 sp) and FP (121 sp). The fragments showed higher similarity between the avifauna. The insectivores and omnivores were dominant in both areas. Two migrants were recorded: Elaenia albiceps (southern migrant) and Tringa solitaria (northern migrant). Only one threatened species was recorded: Carduellis yarrellii. Most species did not have forest abundance, as well as showed low sensitivity.

AB  - Amazonian forest bird communities are among the richest in the world. Even so, relatively little is known about the organization of the entire avian community at local scales or about differences across Amazonia. These are fundamental data not only for understanding the processes generating and maintaining tropical diversity, but also as a baseline for evaluating anthropogenic changes to Amazonian forests. Here we provide a description of the entire bird community for a 100 ha plot of terra firme forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil, based on spot-map and mist net surveys augmented by additional field and analytical techniques. Although our results are from a single plot surveyed in a single year, our methods and interpretation reflect nearly 30 years of ornithological research at the site. We found 228 species on the plot, of which 207 were considered part of the core regional avifauna. Median density was five individuals/100 ha. Only 13 species (6% of the core species) had densities ≥ 20 individuals on the plot, although 55 species (27%) had ≤ 2 individuals. No species had territories smaller than 3 ha; median territory size was 11 ha for the 103 species for which we could make reasonable estimates. Measured by numbers of species or individuals, the plot was dominated by insectivores (54% of species, 62% of individuals). Biomass, however, was dominated by frugivores and granivores (59%). Compared to available data from other Amazonian forests, our site appears to have comparable richness of a similar set of species, but lower density and greater patchiness. Our results suggest that the area required to support populations of many species will be even greater in central Amazonia than in western Amazonia.

AB  - The Zona da Mata Mineira is located in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the Atlantic Forest domain, and it is a highly fragmented region, with many small and isolated patches, whose avifauna is poorly studied. The objective of this work was to survey the avifauna of the Poço D'Anta Municipal Biological Reserve (277 ha), a forest patch at Juiz de Fora county, southeastern Minas Gerais, determining its ecological traits and conservation status. The survey was conducted between March-September 2007 and March 2008-May 2009 using Mackinnon lists, mist-net captures and occasional observations. We identified 156 species, of which 44 (28%) are endemic to the Atlantic Forest and six (3.8%) are of conservation concern. Among the threatened species, five are forest dependent (Dysithamnus stictothorax, Drymophila ochropyga, Sporophila frontalis, Sporophila falcirostris, Cyanoloxia moesta). In general the community is characterized by birds with medium to low sensitivity to environmental perturbations. However, eight (5.1%) species with high sensitivity (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana, Conopophaga melanops, Sclerurus scansor, Xiphorhynchus fuscus, Lepidocolaptes squamatus, Campylorhamphus falcularius, Anabazenops fuscus and Habia rubica) were identified. Moreover, some species once considered extinct in several other fragments in southeastern Minas Gerais were still present in the area. Insectivorous (39.4%, n = 61) and omnivorous (31.6%, n = 49) species were predominant. As a legally protected area and due to its extension, considering the regional characteristics, the Poço D'Anta Municipal Biological Reserve has an important role in harboring populations of birds that has facing persistence anthropogenic effects in the region. The local avifauna is subject to impacts such as running overs, invasions of exotic species and hunting, although there are proposals of mitigation measures in the management plan of the area. It is emphasized the character of urgency regarding the implementation of these measures in order to minimize the impacts suffered by birds.

AB  - In tropical forests, hunting nearly always accompanies logging. The entangled nature of these disturbances complicates our ability to resolve applied questions, such as whether secondary and degraded forest can sustain populations of tropical animals. With the expansion of logging in central Africa, conservation depends on knowledge of the individual and combined impacts of logging and hunting on animal populations. Our goals were (1) to decouple the effects of selective logging and hunting on densities of animal guilds, including apes, duikers, monkeys, elephant, pigs, squirrels, and large frugivorous and insectivorous birds and (2) to compare the relative importance of these disturbances to the effects of local-scale variation in forest structure and fruit abundance. In northern Republic of Congo, we surveyed animals along 30 transects positioned in forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging alone, and neither logging nor hunting. While sampling transects twice per month for two years, we observed 47 179 animals of 19 species and eight guilds in 1154 passages (2861 km). Species densities varied by as much as 480% among forest areas perturbed by logging and/or hunting, demonstrating the strong effects of these disturbances on populations of some species. Densities of animal guilds varied more strongly with disturbance type than with variation in forest structure, canopy cover, and fruit abundance. Independently, logging and hunting decreased density of some guilds and increased density of others: densities varied from 44% lower (pigs) to 90% higher (insectivorous birds) between logged and unlogged forest and from 61% lower (apes) to 77% higher (frugivorous birds) between hunted and unhunted forest. Their combined impacts exacerbated decreases in populations of some guilds (ape, duiker, monkey, and pig), but counteracted one another for others (squirrels, insectivorous and frugivorous birds). Together, logging and hunting shifted the relative abundance of the animal community away from large mammals toward squirrels and birds. Logged forest, even in the absence of hunting, does not maintain similar densities as unlogged forest for most animal guilds. To balance conservation with the need for economic development and wild meat in tropical countries, landscapes should be spatially managed to include protected areas, community hunting zones, and production forest. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - In addition to patch-level attributes (i.e., area and isolation), the nature of land cover between habitat patches (the matrix) may drive colonization and extinction dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Despite a long-standing recognition of matrix effects in fragmented systems, an understanding of the relative impacts of different types of land cover on patterns and dynamics of species occurrence remains limited. We employed multi-season occupancy models to determine the relative influence of patch area, patch isolation, within-patch vegetation structure, and landscape matrix on occupancy dynamics of nine Neotropical insectivorous birds in 99 forest patches embedded in four matrix types (agriculture, suburban development, bauxite mining, and forest) in central Jamaica. We found that within-patch vegetation structure and the matrix type between patches were more important than patch area and patch isolation in determining local colonization and local extinction probabilities, and that the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation structure on occupancy dynamics tended to be matrix and species dependent. Across the avian community, the landscape matrix influenced local extinction more than local colonization, indicating that extinction processes, rather than movement, likely drive interspecific differences in occupancy dynamics. These findings lend crucial empirical support to the hypothesis that species occupancy dynamics in fragmented systems may depend greatly upon the landscape context. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - We identify two processes by which humans increase genetic exchange among groups of individuals: by affecting the distribution of groups and dispersal patterns across a landscape, and by affecting interbreeding among sympatric or parapatric groups. Each of these processes might then have two different effects on biodiversity: changes in the number of taxa through merging or splitting of groups, and the extinction/extirpation of taxa through effects on fitness. We review the various ways in which humans are affecting genetic exchange, and highlight the difficulties in predicting the impacts on biodiversity. Gene flow and hybridization are crucially important evolutionary forces influencing biodiversity. Humans alter natural patterns of genetic exchange in myriad ways, and these anthropogenic effects are likely to influence the genetic integrity of populations and species. We argue that taking a gene-centric view towards conservation will help resolve issues pertaining to conservation and management. © 2011 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - One and a half centuries after Darwin visited Chiloe Island, what he described as "...an island covered by one great forest..." has lost two-thirds of its forested areas. At this biodiversity hotspot, forest surface is becoming increasingly fragmented due to unregulated logging, clearing for pastures and replacement by exotic tree plantations. Decrease in patch size, increased isolation and "edge effects" can influence the persistence of forest species in remnant fragments. We assessed how these variables affect local density for six forest birds, chosen to include the most important seed dispersers (four species) and bird pollinators (two species, one of which acts also as seed disperser), plus the most common insectivore (Aphrastura spinicauda). Based on cue-count point surveys (8 points per fragment), we estimated bird densities for each species in 22 forest fragments of varying size, shape, isolation and internal-habitat structure (e.g. tree size and epiphyte cover). Bird densities varied with fragment connectivity (three species) and shape (three species), but none of the species was significantly affected by patch size. Satellite image analyses revealed that, from 1985 to 2008, forested area decreased by 8.8% and the remaining forest fragments became 16% smaller, 58-73% more isolated and 11-50% more regular. During that period, bird density estimates for the northern part of Chiloé (covering an area of 1214.75 km2) decreased for one species (elaenia), increased for another two (chucao and hummingbird) and did not vary for three (rayadito, thrust and blackbird). For the first three species, changes in patch features respectively exacerbated, balanced and overcame the effects of forest loss on bird population size (landscape-level abundance). Hence, changes in patch features can modulate the effect of habitat fragmentation on forest birds, suggesting that spatial planning (guided by spatially-explicit models) can be an effective tool to facilitate their conservation. © 2011 Magrach et al.

AB  - Aim To compare the ability of island biogeography theory, niche theory and species-energy theory to explain patterns of species richness and density for breeding bird communities across islands with contrasting characteristics. Location Thirty forested islands in two freshwater lakes in the boreal forest zone of northern Sweden (65°55'N to 66°09'N; 17°43'E to 17°55'E). Methods We performed bird censuses on 30 lake islands that have each previously been well characterized in terms of size, isolation, habitat heterogeneity (plant diversity and forest age), net primary productivity (NPP), and invertebrate prey abundance. To test the relative abilities of island biogeography theory, niche theory and species-energy theory to describe bird community patterns, we used both traditional statistical approaches (linear and multiple regressions) and structural equation modelling (SEM; in which both direct and indirect influences can be quantified). Results Using regression-based approaches, area and bird abundance were the two most important predictors of bird species richness. However, when the data were analysed by SEM, area was not found to exert a direct effect on bird species richness. Instead, terrestrial prey abundance was the strongest predictor of bird abundance, and bird abundance in combination with NPP was the best predictor of bird species richness. Area was only of indirect importance through its positive effect on terrestrial prey abundance, but habitat heterogeneity and spatial subsidies (emerging aquatic insects) also showed important indirect influences. Thus, our results provided the strongest support for species-energy theory. Main conclusions Our results suggest that, by using statistical approaches that allow for analyses of both direct and indirect influences, a seemingly direct influence of area on species richness can be explained by greater energy availability on larger islands. As such, animal community patterns that seem to be in line with island biogeography theory may be primarily driven by energy availability. Our results also point to the need to consider several aspects of habitat quality (e.g. heterogeneity, NPP, prey availability and spatial subsidies) for successful management of breeding bird diversity at local spatial scales and in fragmented or insular habitats. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We studied the diversity and distribution of diurnal birds in a large city in south-eastern Australia. Approximately 220,000 bird records were extracted from the Atlas of Australian Birds project (1998-2002) for Melbourne, and filtered on the basis of representativeness in surveys. The filtered data for 142 species were subjected to cluster analysis to recognise assemblages, and ordination and guild analysis to determine spatial and functional organisation. Measures of the intensity of urbanisation and environmental characteristics of Melbourne were used to test the separation of the avifauna into broad urban tolerant and urban avoider assemblages and subassemblages. Distribution and relative abundance of urban tolerant birds were found to be positively associated with areas of higher urban intensity, while urban avoiders were associated with areas of lower urban intensity in natural areas within the urban matrix or along its periphery. Urban tolerant species are medium-sized, generalist foragers, which use cavities and canopy sites for nesting, while urban avoiders are either small or very large, foraging specialists (particularly insectivores), which nest on or near the ground as well as in the canopy or shrub layer. Our study confirms that cities do include habitats that are important for a number of urban adapted birds, and suggests ways in which conserving bird diversity can be accommodated in urban planning frameworks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spatial distribution and spatial relationships in capture rates of understorey insectivorous birds and density of arthropods were investigated in a patch of upper montane rain forest in Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil, from January to December 2004. The composition of the arthropod fauna collected was similar to that reported for other tropical forests, with predominance of Araneae, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera non-Heteroptera. A total of 26 bird species were captured, among which the more common were Dysithamnus mentalis, Conopophaga lineata, Platyrinchus mystaceus, Basileuterus culicivorus and Sclerurus scansor. Variation in the bird capture rates among sampling net lines were not correlated with arthropod density. Rather, individual analyses of some bird species suggest that spatial distribution of understorey insectivorous birds is better explained by habitat type.

AB  - Large areas of tropical forest now exist as remnants scattered across agricultural landscapes, and so understanding the impacts of forest fragmentation is important for biodiversity conservation. We examined species richness and nestedness among tropical forest remnants in birds (meta-analysis of published studies) and insects (field data for fruit-feeding Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and ants). Species-area relationships were evident in all four taxa, and avian and insect assemblages in remnants typically were nested subsets of those in larger areas. Avian carnivores and nectarivores and predatory ants were more nested than other guilds, implying that the sequential loss of species was more predictable in these groups, and that fragmentation alters the trophic organization of communities. For butterflies, the ordering of fragments to achieve maximum nestedness was by fragment area, suggesting that differences among fragments were driven mainly by extinction. In contrast for moths, maximum nestedness was achieved by ordering species by wing length; species with longer wings (implying better dispersal) were more likely to occur at all sites, including low diversity sites, suggesting that differences among fragments were driven more strongly by colonization. Although all four taxa exhibited high levels of nestedness, patterns of species turnover were also idiosyncratic, and thus even species-poor sites contributed to landscape-scale biodiversity, particularly for insects. © 2011 The Royal Society.

AB  - To assess the impact of habitat fragmentation on tropical avian communities, we sampled lowland forest birds on six land-bridge islands and two mainland forest sites in Lake Kenyir, Peninsular Malaysia using timed point counts, hypothesizing that insectivorous birds are the worst affected guild. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the effects of area, isolation, primary dietary guild (omnivore, frugivore and insectivore) and their interactions in predicting species richness, abundance and diversity. Our analysis showed that a model that considered the effects of area, dietary guild and their interaction best explained observed patterns of species richness. But a model considering both area and dietary guild best explained the variation in abundance. Notably, insectivorous birds were singled out as the dietary guild most sensitive to fragmentation, followed by frugivorous and omnivorous birds and hence provide support for our hypothesis. Assemblages of insectivorous birds were clearly depauperate on anthropogenic forest islands in Lake Kenyir and are consistent with forest fragmentation studies in the Neotropics. Given their specialized foraging ecology and diversity, conservation of intact communities of insectivorous bird guilds in Malaysia will be critical for maintaining predator-prey interactions in lowland tropical forests. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - This study compared niche breath, prey size, and diet variability in two pairs of sympatric species of terrestrial insectivorous birds, each pair containing one species that can persist in small forest fragments and one that does not. The pairs were Myrmeciza ferruginea and Sclerurus rufigularis; and Formicarius colma and F. analis, respectively. The prey availability in forest fragments was also sampled and compared to the availability in continuous forests. Niche breath indices did not differ between pair members, but diet variability differed in the opposite direction from that hypothesized. Although the two bird species most vulnerable to fragmentation fed on larger prey than less vulnerable species, prey availability, including that based on prey size did not differ among fragmented versus continuous forest sites. Thus, diet per se appeared not to be an important cause of extinctionproneness in these species. The simplest explanation proposed, that vulnerability to fragmentation was directly related to territory size, requires testing. However, it was consistent with observations that the bird species feeding on larger prey also need larger territories.

AB  - Land cover and land use surrounding fragmented habitat can greatly impact species persistence by altering resource availability, edge effects, or the movement of individuals throughout a landscape. Despite the potential importance of the landscape matrix, ecologists still have limited understanding of the relative effects of different types of land cover and land uses on species patterns and processes in natural systems. Here we investigated whether Neotropical resident bird communities in limestone forest patches differed if they were embedded in three different human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) relative to sites in continuous forest in central Jamaica. We found that species richness, community composition, and abundances were matrix-dependent, with agricultural landscapes supporting greater avian diversity and more intact community assemblages than either peri-urban or bauxite landscapes. Abundance of almost 70% of species differed in forest embedded in the different landscape matrix types. Traits related to resource use best predicted species responses, including diet guild, nest height, habitat association, and foraging strata. Insectivores, frugivores, canopy nesters, understory and canopy foragers, and forest-restricted species rarely observed in matrix habitats had lower abundances in forest fragments embedded in human-dominated matrix types than in continuous forest. In contrast, nectarivores, omnivores, granivores, ground and multi-strata nesters, ground foragers, and species regularly in matrix habitats were least sensitive to forest fragmentation. Results suggest that structure, composition, and land use disturbance regimes in matrix areas impact overall habitat quality in landscapes by potentially mediating resource availability inside as well as outside forest habitat. This study reinforces the importance of differentiating among land cover and land uses in fragmentation research and lends support to the hypothesis that resource availability may be a primary factor driving Neotropical bird responses to fragmentation. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Tropical dry evergreen forests (TDEF) are a unique forest type found along the east coast of India. They mostly occur as small, isolated fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to ≈10. ha) and are considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology, anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious. Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged from 10% to 56%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set. Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85%) had a generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects, such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However, only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants but also for pollinating insects. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Considered one of the biomes that concentrates most of endemism In the world, the Atlantic forest is also one of the most fragmented and threatened biomes of the world. Knowledge on the remaining avifauna in this region Is scarce, especially about trophic guilds that can help measure the vulnerability of these species In relation to the processes of habitats fragmentation and degradation. The aim of this study was to Identify the food items which are consumed by the guilds of birds of this region and to evaluate the diet of some endemic species of this blome. The study was conducted by analyzing stomach contents (alcoolpreserved) of voucher specimens deposited In the Ornithological Collection of the Zoology Department of the Federal University from Minas Gerais. From 98 bird species and 25 families we evaluated the stomach contents of 219 individuals. In the diet remainings 18 different food items were Identified, most abundantly seeds and insects of the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. The indicator species analysis showed that only Coleóptera and Hemiptera were indicators of the diet of insectivorous birds, while in omnivores plant remainings were predominant. Twenty-one endemic species which consumed 14 different food items were also Included In the study. Considering the limited literature regarding the diet of the endemic species of Atlantic forest, the results contribute to a better knowledge about the diet of these species. The data summarized In this study show some of the food characteristics of various bird species which may serve as a basis for further research, conservation strategies, and future plans for managing the indigenous avifauna of the Atlantic forest. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - Understanding the ranging behavior and habitat selection of understory tropical birds is important for corridor design and enhancing functional connectivity in fragmented tropical landscapes. Here we report on the ranging behavior and habitat selection of three terrestrial insectivorous bird species, the spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Usambara thrush Turdus roehli and orange ground thrush Zoothera gurneyi, in the East (EUM) and West (WUM) Usambara Mountains in north-east Tanzania. Based on 5945 locations and 3676 bird radio-tracking hours conducted between 2001 and 2008 at four study sites in the EUM and WUM, we determined that the 95% kernel home range and 50% kernel core range for the spot-throat, Usambara thrush, and orange ground thrush are similar yet large (aggregate mean home range=10.3±1.1 ha; aggregate mean core range 1.5±0.4 ha); that these species are adverse to crossing non-forested openings - no bird was recorded over the course of the study to cross a non-forested opening >15 m; and that the most extinction-prone species in our study system, the spot-throat and Usambara thrush, preferentially used slightly disturbed and primary forest, respectively. These results indicate that maintaining continuous forest cover and minimizing forest disturbance in corridors in the Eastern Arc Mountains is important for enhancing their habitat suitability for these species. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: To examine the response of forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages and feeding guilds to patch characteristics of forest fragments in the context of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in an area that supports high levels of species diversity and endemism. Location: Dune, riverine, sand and swamp forest fragments in southern Mozambique's Maputaland. Methods: We recorded 20 forest-dependent and 69 generalist bird species at 220 survey points in 30 forest fragments that ranged in size from 5 to 7432 ha and that were 100 to 5100 m apart. We used linear regressions to relate the number of species to forest fragment size, isolation, perimeter, fractal dimension, shape and core area for frugivores, insectivores, granivores, nectarivores, carnivores and omnivores separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages. We tested for modality in occupancy frequency distributions of species in forest fragments and used the binary matrix temperature calculator to determine whether the assemblages had a nested structure separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird species. Results: The number of forest-dependent and generalist bird species categorized into the feeding guilds varied independently from forest patch parameter values. Occupancy models showed a random distribution for forest-dependent birds, and generalists had a unimodal distribution. Both the forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages had a non-nested structure. The presence of eight rare forest-dependent and four endemic bird species in 22 of the 30 fragments contributed to the non-nested structure of these bird assemblages. Main conclusions: Fragmented forests did not induce the expected responses of the forest bird assemblages in that the number of species was not explained by patch characteristics, nor could we find evidence for metapopulation dynamics. Non-nestedness may be caused by the few rare and endemic species occupying forest fragments with a wide range of patch characteristics. Knowledge of the response of species to forest fragmentation can benefit conservation planning catering for rare and endemic species. Our study suggests that all forest fragments in the region may have to be included in a conservation network to complement existing landscape-based plans to protect the region. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Five main conclusions arise from this review of the responses of species to anthropogenic disturbance in Madagascar: First, species' reactions to anthropogenic disturbance are generally negative, but remain poorly known. Our knowledge is patchy among and within higher taxonomic groups; we are still largely gathering case studies. Second, taxonomic groups vary considerably in which proximate factors are most important. Third, several groups show differing responses within different ecoregions. Whether these differences are consistent across groups requires further testing. Fourth, related species often have divergent reactions to disturbance, even within lower taxonomic groupings (families or genera). Thus, we cannot rely on phylogenetic relatedness or even ecological similarity to infer similarity in responses. Finally, disturbance typically reduces species diversity (especially of native and/or endemic species), but also causes species turnover, typically with forest specialists replaced by grassland generalists, and endemics replaced by non-endemics (including invasives). Given these knowledge gaps, we stress the urgency of applied studies that assess species' ecology, behaviour and health across disturbance gradients, including purely anthropogenic landscapes. Remaining natural vegetation and protected areas will be unable to preserve Madagascar's biodiversity under the impact of climatic change; we must understand responses of plants and animals to disturbance in order to create buffer zones and corridors combining secondary, degraded and natural habitats. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Cerrado domain is a mosaic of vegetation types at the local scale, and this environmental heterogeneity leads to high regional bird diversity. Therefore, we aimed to survey quantitative and qualitatively the bird fauna of two fragments of Cerrado and to compare them with an adjacent protected area (Estação Ecológica de Itirapina), in order to assess the heterogeneity of bird diversity in the region. The present study was conducted during 12 months from October 2006 to September 2007 in the municipality of Itirapina, Southeastern Brazil. Altogether we recorded 210 bird species. Fifty-six of them had never been detected in Estação Ecológica de Itirapina, and eleven species are new records for the whole Itirapina region. The list also includes six species that are endangered in Sao Paulo State and five endemic species of the Cerrado domain. Most species were recorded in less than 50% of the visits and exhibited low relative abundance. Primarily insectivorous species were the most common, followed by omnivores. Frugivorous birds were poorly represented. Carnivores were more abundant than usually observed in fragments. The similarity among fragments was higher than between fragments and the protected area. Considering the vegetation heterogeneity in the Cerrado domain, our results reinforce the importance of conserving fragments in order to sample this diversity.

AB  - Despite the fact that tree plantations are not able to completely replace the ecological function of natural forests, the present study proposes to evaluate for which bird species or avian groups tree plantations act as habitat in fragmented landscape in southern Brazil. We compared the richness and abundance of bird species in a natural forest to adjacent plantations of Araucaria, a native tree species and of pine, an exotic plant in South America. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of tree plantations on richness of avian groups with different levels of dependence on forest habitat, feeding habits and foraging strata as well as on threatened species. The fixed 100. m radius point-counts method was used. A total of 114 bird species were recorded in all areas. Of those, 93 occurred in natural forest, 87 in Araucaria plantations and 81 in pine plantations. These results indicate that richness and abundance were lower in the pine plantations than in the natural forest and in the Araucaria plantations. Araucaria plantations can be used by a high number of bird species and their richness was not significantly lower than that observed in the adjacent natural forest. Our results suggest that Araucaria plantations could act as habitat for a large number of bird species, especially for forest-dependents species, insectivores, frugivores and species at different threat categories. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Quality of the agricultural matrix profoundly affects biodiversity and dispersal in agricultural areas. Vegetatively complex coffee agroecosystemsmaintain species richness at larger distances from the forest. Epiphytes colonize canopy trees and provide resources for birds and insects and thus effects of agricultural production on epiphytes may affect other species. We compared diversity, composition, and vertical stratification of epiphytes in a forest fragment and in two coffee farms differing in management intensity in southern Mexico. We also examined spatial distribution of epiphytes with respect to the forest fragment to examine quality of the two agricultural matrix types for epiphyte conservation. We sampled vascular epiphytes in a forest fragment, a shade polyculture farm, and a shade monoculture farm at 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m from the forest. Epiphyte and orchid richness was greater in the forest than in the monoculture but richness was similar in the forest and polyculture farm. Epiphyte species composition differed with habitat type, but not with distance from the forest. In the forest, epiphytes were distributed throughout tree canopies, but in the farms, epiphytes were primarily found on trunks and larger branches. Epiphyte richness and species similarity to forest species declined with distance from the forest fragment in the monoculture, but richness and similarity to forest species did not decline with distance from forest in the polyculture. This suggests polyculture coffee has greater conservation value. In contrast, monoculture coffee is likely a sink habitat for epiphytes dispersing from forests into coffee. Coffee farms differ from forests in terms of the habitat they provide and species composition, thus protecting forest fragments is essential for epiphyte conservation. Nonetheless, in agricultural landscapes, vegetatively complex coffee farms may contribute to conservation of epiphytes more than other agricultural land uses. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Worldwide loss of biodiversity necessitates a clear understanding of the factors driving population declines as well as informed predictions about which species and populations are at greatest risk. The biggest threat to the long-term persistence of populations is the reduction and changes in configuration of their natural habitat. Inconsistencies have been noted in the responses of populations to the combined effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. These have been widely attributed to the effects of the matrix habitats in which remnant focal habitats are typically embedded. We quantified the potential effects of the inter-patch matrix by estimating occupancy and colonization of forest and surrounding non-forest matrix (NF). We estimated species-specific parameters using a dynamic, multi-species hierarchical model on a bird community in southwestern Costa Rica. Overall, we found higher probabilities of occupancy and colonization of forest relative to the NF across bird species, including those previously categorized as open habitat generalists not needing forest to persist. Forest dependency was a poor predictor of occupancy dynamics in our study region, largely predicting occupancy and colonization of only non-forest habitats. Our results indicate that the protection of remnant forest habitats is key for the long-term persistence of all members of the bird community in this fragmented landscape, including species typically associated with open, non-forest habitats. Synthesis and applications. We identified 39 bird species of conservation concern defined by having high estimates of forest occupancy, and low estimates of occupancy and colonization of non-forest. These species survive in forest but are unlikely to venture out into open, non-forested habitats, therefore, they are vulnerable to the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Our hierarchical community-level model can be used to estimate species-specific occupancy dynamics for focal and inter-patch matrix habitats to identify which species within a community are likely to be impacted most by habitat loss and fragmentation. This model can be applied to other taxa (i.e. amphibians, mammals and insects) to estimate species and community occurrence dynamics in response to current environmental conditions and to make predictions in response to future changes in habitat configurations. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Urban parks can harbour small populations of saproxylic insects of high conservation concern, such as Osmoderma eremita and other rare beetles. These areas often host old trees which have become very uncommon in rural areas where they are threatened by commercial forestry management procedures based on frequent tree cutting. Nevertheless, old trees of urban parks may represent a hazard for public safety and are sometimes cut by management authorities. The aim of this work was to assess the loss of reproductive sites for saproxylic beetles of the Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae and Cerambycidae, when felling plans are adopted according to a Visual Tree Assessment Procedure (VTA), in a Mediterranean urban park. On July-August 2004, 1,247 holm oaks were surveyed within the border of an urban park of Rome (Villa Borghese). The occurrence of saproxylic beetles (i.e. the presence of frass, living insects or their remains) was verified in 66 old holm oaks, 41% of which were doomed to cutting by VTA. Eleven of these trees (41% of the trees doomed to be cut) held fragments of adults and sometimes living larvae of Osmoderma eremita, and four of them (36%) were included in the felling plan. The presence of Osmodermaeremita in tree holes was more frequent in deep cavities. The presence of frass in the cavities was positively associated with tree height and a high degree of damage at the root collar and negatively with the presence of hole-nesting birds. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce diversity of tropical bird communities, but the predictability of how communities in fragments disintegrate over time remains unclear. We compared bird community changes of two lowland forest reserves, La Selva Biological Station (LSBS), Costa Rica and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, both approximately the same size (1500 ha) and at similar latitude (9-10 N) in Central America. Both reserves are losing bird species despite LSBS's connection to an existing large park (incomplete isolation) and BCI's favorable location within a largely forested landscape. We examined characteristics of guilds and species lost from the sites to determine whether patterns were similar, and thus predictable. Some of the same guilds declined at both reserves, particularly insectivores and ground/understory nesters. At LSBS mixed-species flock participants, forest species, and burrow-nesters also declined or became extirpated disproportionately. At BCI edge species became extirpated. Body mass was a poor predictor of species and guild loss at both sites, except for carnivores at La Selva. Thus, fragmentation appears to influence some guilds more than others, but which species decline or disappear in tropical forest fragments is also influenced by site-specific factors, mostly yet to be determined. We need to understand such idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation better, rather than rely on one-size-fits-all management plans to conserve bird communities in tropical forest fragments. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bird species richness is an important measure for monitoring biodiversity changes. We analysed avifauna richness and composition in a 472 ha protected cerrado fragment and surroundings at Fazenda Canchim (RL-CPPSE), São Carlos, in the State of São Paulo (SP). We carried out 95.1 hours of observation (22 visits) at irregular intervals from May 2004 to December 2006. Qualitative surveys were done walking through tracks inside the fragment and on the roads at its edge. We recorded 160 species, six of which were endemic to Cerrado domain, 22 migratory, seven threatened within the State of São Paulo, and two globally threatened. We found 28 species in the cerradão, 110 in the cerrado sensu stricto, 13 in the gallery forest, 26 in the reservoir border, 26 in pasturelands and sugar cane monoculture and 55 in an anthropic area. Most of the species had low frequency of occurrence in all vegetation forms. Insectivores were the major trophic category (46.9%), which is typical in tropical regions, and it is also related to resource availability. Omnivores followed with 19.4%, granivores with 8.8% and frugivores with 7.5%. We conclude that, despite its size and conservation status, our study area has a remarkable bird community and must be considered as a priority conservation area to preserve bird species in Sao Paulo State.

AB  - Myrsine coriacea, known as "capororoca", produces a large number of small, round fruits, with a thin pericarp and dark purple colours when ripe. The objective of the present study was to identify bird species using M. coriacea for the consumption of fruit and insects or for perching alone in the Aparados da Serra National Park (Brazil). Thirty-one bird species were recorded, among which 23 consumed fruits. The species of birds Tangara preciosa, Cyclarhis gujanensis, Leucochloris albicollis, and Zonotrichia capensis, the plant used only for landing and Colaptes campestris, Xiphorhyncus fuscus, Leptasthenura setari and Xenops rutilans used the plant to search for insects. Fragment area size and monthly variation did not affect the diversity of birds that visited the tree or the number of events recorded for each type of behaviour. The fruits of M. coriacea were largely consumed by birds and the seeds could have been potentially released by them, thus contributing to the maintenance and regeneration of fragments of tropical forest, in the PNAS.

AB  - We recorded 205 bird species at the Península de Osa. The geographical distribution of most forest bird species within the peninsula is discontinuous (e.g., Corapipo altera and Tangara guttata), even within large forest tracts, indicating the adaptation of species to particular habitats, microhabitats, strata and/or diet within the forest. Birds use the forest strata in different proportion resulting in three different patterns: understory birds (e.g., Arremon aurantiirostris and Habia atrimaxillaris), supdosel birds (e.g., Cacicus uropygialis and Euphonia imitans), and birds that use several strata in similar proportion (e.g., Dendrocincla anabatina). Most of these forest birds feed upon insects and fruits. The density and relative abundance is very low for most species, with more than 90% of the species having less than an individual per hectare or kilometer of transect. These characteristics make this avifauna highly susceptible to deforestation and forest fragmentation.

AB  - We studied patterns of genetic differentiation in a connected landscape with an interesting history of human habitat conversion that began two centuries ago, during the Brazilian colonization period. In the fragments of Brazilian Atlantic seasonal forest and corridors of secondary forest, Protium spruceanum is an abundant native, mass-flowering/insect-pollinated and bird-dispersed tree. Genetic diversity was analyzed from 230 individuals in five fragments (1 to 11.8 ha) and four corridors (460 to 1000 m length) using allozyme loci. We did not find evidence of inbreeding within fragments or corridors, but the proportion of heterozygotes (f̂) were significantly higher in fragments than in the secondary vegetation corridors, based on Goudet's G-test (P = 0.036). Genetic differentiation was low and no pattern of isolation by distance was detected. All fragments generally present low historical genetic differentiation with corridors that they are connected, indicating possible gene flow via seeds and pollen. Due to the consistently low differentiation observed among them and the absence of a significant reduction in gene diversity in second-growth forests, we conclude that corridors of second-growth forests would be an important alternative in the genetic connection of isolated forest fragments.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation increases the temporal variability in species richness and abundance of forest birds. Therefore, changes in the ecological interactions at which birds are engaged might be transient. Furthermore, despite changes in insectivory rates might have cascading effects if such changes are permanent, there are no evaluations of the persistency of changes in insectivory rates. In this study, we assessed the persistency of changes in insectivory in forest fragments, comparing the intensity of insectivory upon artificial insect larvae at three different years at a single site in central Chile. In coastal Maulino forest, the intensity of insectivory is persistently higher in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. An increase in insectivory might reduce herbivorous insect abundance which is translated into higher growth rates in seedlings at forest fragments, a factor that is changing forest dynamics. Our study suggests that the variation in bird insectivory on fragmented forest is a permanent phenomenon, which might have profound implication for the dynamics of the forest remnants. © Akadémiai Kiadó Budapest.

AB  - This paper assesses the response of four common species of forest dependant insectivorous birds to an urban-forest gradient. The presence or absence was recorded for each species in landscapes that varied in landscape and site level attributes. Landscapes were classified into three categories based on their level of urbanisation. Broad comparisons across the landscapes were used to determine species specific response to increasing levels of urbanisation. Site level attributes were modelled to predict the patch occupancy for each species in each of the landscape types. Two broad trends were identified: the superb fairy wren (Malurus cyaneus) and white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) displayed a tolerance to urbanisation and the eastern yellow robin (Eosaltrica australis) and white throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus) demonstrated a threshold response to urbanisation. The density of roads (-ve) and the extent of tree cover (+ve) in a landscape were highly correlated with the occurrence of urban sensitive species while at the site level the density of roads and density of rivers were the strongest contributors to their presence. The marked differences in the isolation and connectivity of patches where the threshold for urban sensitive species ceases are the likely contributors to their decline and sensitivity to suburban habitats. Conservation and management of urban sensitive species is largely dependant on the way urban development is managed. Of critical importance is careful planning in urban-fringe environments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been no published research on how Malaysian birds respond to the creation of a forest edge. In this study we evaluated bird species composition, distribution and diversity along edge-interior gradient in an isolated lowland tropical rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. There was a significant difference in overall species abundance among different distances from edge. Among the four super-abundant species, two showed a significant decrease in the numbers observed from the edge to interior, namely striped tit-babbler, and yellow-vented bulbul. Among the five trophic guilds, the Insectivore/Frugivore guild showed a significant decrease from the forest edge to the interior, while the Insectivore guild showed a significant increase from edge to the interior. The rarefaction curve showed that the expected number of bird species is highest at 400 m from edge, and lowest at 25 m and 1200 m from edge. The diversity indices were lowest at the edge. Many of the edge species were most common in a band 200 m-wide along the edge. We found that several of the forest-interior species increased in diversity starting 400 m from edge to the forest interior. Our findings indicate that habitat fragmentation and habitat isolation affect bird communities and that these factors threaten many species. With continued deforestation and habitat isolation in peninsular Malaysia, we predict many more bird species will be adversely affected.

AB  - Ecosystems have an essential role in providing services to humankind such as nutrient cycling, pest control, pollination, quality of life, and hydrological, atmospheric and climatic regulation. About 60% of the world's known ecosystems are currently used unsustainably. In Europe, the richness and abundance of biodiversity is undergoing significant decline, partly due to climate change. This article outlines the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by showing both observed and projected changes in the distribution and phenology of plants and animals (phenology refers to changes in the timing of seasonal events). The four major findings are the following. (1) Concerning the distribution of plant species, climate change is responsible for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species. By the late 21st century, distributions of European plant species are projected to have shifted several hundred kilometres to the north, forests are likely to have contracted in the south and expanded in the north, and 60% of mountain plant species may face extinction. The rate of change will exceed the ability of many species to adapt. (2) Concerning plant phenology, the timing of seasonal events in plants is changing across Europe due to changes in climate conditions. For instance, 78% of leaf unfolding and flowering records show advancing trends. Between 1971 and 2000, the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade. The pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier and is longer than 50 years ago. Trends in seasonal events will continue to advance as climate warming increases in the years and decades to come. (3) Concerning the distribution of animal species, Europe's birds, insects, and mammals are moving northwards and uphill in response to observed climate change. Rate of climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles will impede the movement of many animal species. Distribution changes are projected to continue. Suitable climatic conditions for Europe's breeding birds are projected to shift nearly 550 km northeast by the end of the century. Projections for 120 native European mammals suggest that up to 9% face extinction during the 21st century. (4) Concerning animal phenology, climatic warming has caused advancement in the life cycles of many animal groups, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. Seasonal advancement is particularly strong and rapid in the Arctic. Breeding seasons are lengthening, allowing extra generations of temperature-sensitive insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and pest species to be produced during the year. These trends are projected to continue as climate warming increases in the decades to come. Populations may explode if the young are not exposed to normal predation pressures. Conversely, populations may crash if the emergence of vulnerable young is not in synchrony with their main food source or if shorter hibernation times lead to declines in body condition. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species. Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Predators are thought to play a key role in controlling herbivory, thus having positive indirect effects on plants. However, evidence for terrestrial trophic cascades is still fragmentary, perhaps due to variation in top-down forces created by environmental heterogeneity. We examined the magnitude of predation effects on foliar damage by chewing insects and mean leaf size, by excluding birds from saplings in 'dry' and 'wet' Nothofagus pumilio forests in the northern Patagonian Andes, Argentina. The experiment lasted 2 years encompassing a severe drought during the La Niña phase of a strong El Niño/Southern Oscillation event, which was followed by unusually high background folivory levels. Insect damage was consistently higher in wet than in dry forest saplings. In the drought year (1999), bird exclusion increased folivory rates in both forests but did not affect tree leaf size. In the ensuing season (2000), leaf damage was generally twice as high as in the drought year. As a result, bird exclusion not only increased the extent of folivory but also significantly decreased sapling leaf size. The latter effect was stronger in the wet forest, suggesting compensation of leaf area loss by dry forest saplings. Overall, the magnitude of predator indirect effects depended on the response variable measured. Insectivorous birds were more effective at reducing folivory than at facilitating leaf area growth. Our results indicate that bird-initiated trophic cascades protect N. pumilio saplings from insect damage even during years with above-normal herbivory, and also support the view that large-scale climatic events influence the strength of trophic cascades. © 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.

AB  - The Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis) is one of many common neotropical migrants whose populations are in decline across their range. Influences of habitat loss and degradation on breeding or wintering grounds have been postulated as possible causes, but few empirical data exist to support a specific cause. Based on previous studies linking abundances of Canada warbler and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), we hypothesized that the Canada warbler may be influenced by a persistent decline in spruce budworm throughout the bird's breeding range, a hypothesis that has received little attention. This hypothesis makes 5 predictions: 1) budworm outbreaks and warbler detections should be spatially and temporally coincident; 2) the relationship between Canada warbler and spruce budworm outbreaks should be similar to relationships for other warblers known to be spruce budworm associates; 3) the relationship should be stronger than for warblers lacking an association with spruce budworm; 4) because temporal trends of both spruce budworm and Canada warblers have varied throughout Canadian provinces, declines in Canada warblers should be seen only in provinces where spruce budworm also declined; and 5) variation in Canada warbler abundance should reflect variation in supply of preferred habitat for the spruce budworm if habitat rather than budworm abundance is the key. Our analyses supported predictions 14, suggesting that Canada warbler may be even more closely associated with spruce budworm than are known associated species, a phenomenon noted in the literature but previously unexplained. Prediction 5 was not supported, because budworm habitat (area of mature and older balsam fir Abies balsamea and white spruce Picea glauca) remained constant in Ontario while warbler abundance declined. Although the correlative nature of these results precludes inference of a causal relationship between the declines of the Canada warbler and spruce budworm, we postulate that potential links may exist directly, where spruce budworm outbreaks provide elevated levels of insect prey items for breeding Canada warblers, or indirectly through changes in forest structure and composition following outbreaks. These results have implications when considering long-term trends in Canada warbler populations, because it may be impossible to alter population trends for species linked to the timing and magnitude of spruce budworm outbreaks.

AB  - Bird species within the Furnariidae are found in vertical strata in the rainforest from the understory to the canopy. Their diet is composed mainly by insects and they forrage on arthropods that accumulate in leaves and leaf litter. This study aims to analyze how two simpatric species, Philydor atricapillus and P. rufum use the food available in the habitat. We estimated arthropod availability, bird capture rates in mist nets and diet composition (regurgitation using tartar emetic 1% and fecal samples). The study was carried out in an Atlantic rainforest area (23°10'58"S, 44°12'49"W) with little anthropic disturbance between December 2004 and May 2007. The estimate of food availability was made by collecting green leaves, dead leaves and leaf litter used as substrate for invertebrates where the birds studied were observed foraging. We used a branch clipper composed of a gardening scissor and a basket adapted to 2 m aluminum poles. Leaves were collected at four different heights, 1.5 m, 3 m, 4.5 m and 6 m. Ants were the arthropods most frequently captured at 1.5 m and spiders at the other three heights categories. Coleoptera and Orthoptera were also sampled with high frequency. Both bird species had a similar diet composition, with Coleoptera being the most frequent order in the faecal and regurgitate samples. Hemiptera was almost as important in the composition of P. rufum diet and for P. atricapillus, Orthopetra, Hemiptera, Formicidae and Lepidoptera were also important. The percentage of success in use of the tartar administration was of 93.3% for P. atricapillus, with only two deaths occurring in a total of 30 individuals subjected to the method, and 100% for P. rufum in a total of 16 individuals.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes, species persistence within isolated habitat patches is governed by a myriad of species life-history, habitat patch and landscape characteristics. We investigated the inter-specific variation in non-forest gap-crossing abilities of an entire tropical forest-dependent avifauna. We then related this measure of dispersal ability to species life-history characteristics and occupancy data from 31 variable-sized forest patches sampled within the same fragmented forest landscape. A total of 5436 gap-crossing movements of 231 forest-dependent bird species were observed across ten linear forest gaps of varying widths, adjacent to large areas of undisturbed forest. Species persistence in isolated fragments was strongly linked to gap-crossing ability. The most capable gap-crossers were medium to large-bodied species in the large insectivore, frugivore and granivore guilds, matching the most prevalent subset of species in small forest patches. However, some competent gap-crossing species failed to occur in small patches, and minimum forest-patch area requirements were more important in determining patch occupancy for these species. Narrow forest gaps (4-70 m) created by roads and power-lines may become territory boundaries, thereby eliminating home-range gap-crossing movements for many forest species, but permit rarer dispersal events. Wider gaps (>70 m) may inhibit gap-crossing behaviour for all but the most vagile species. Although patch size and quality may be the most important factors in structuring species assemblages in forest fragments, our results show that the degree of patch isolation and permeability of the surrounding matrix also explain which species can persist in forest isolates. Reducing the number and width of forest-dividing gaps; maintaining and/or creating forest corridors and increasing matrix permeability through the creation and maintenance of 'stepping-stone' structures will maximise the species retention in fragmented tropical forest landscapes. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - To investigate the potential causes of changes to bird communities in exurban areas, we examined the relationship between bird and macroinvertebrate communities in exurbanized forest. We randomly located sampling points across a gradient of exurbanization. We used point counts to quantify bird communities and sweep netting, soil cores, pitfalls, and frass collectors to quantify macroinvertebrates. Bird communities had higher richness and abundance in exurban areas compared to undeveloped forests, and lost some species of conservation concern but gained others. The macroinvertebrate community was slightly more abundant in exurban areas, with a slight shift in taxonomic composition. The abundance of macroinvertebrates in soil cores (but not pitfalls) predicted the abundance of ground-foraging birds. The abundance of macroinvertebrates in sweep nets was not associated with the abundance of aerial insectivore birds. Exurbanization therefore appears to change bird and macroinvertebrate communities, but to a lesser extent than agricultural forest fragmentation or intensive urbanization. © 2009 Jordan M.

AB  - Many orders and families of invertebrates have been promoted as ecological and environmental indicators of management practices and natural disturbances in forest ecosystems. To date most research has focused on ants, particularly for gauging the success of efforts to restore lands modified by human disturbance. However, it is now recognised that a range of taxa are potentially required. Here, beetles, butterflies, ants and spiders have received interest as potential candidates for the 'shopping basket'. Less well known, but of great importance, are responses by the hyperdiverse order Hemiptera (true bugs). Recent research along a latitudinal gradient shows Hemiptera to be one of the best orders of invertebrate at discriminating between different forest types. This paper reviews the benefits of incorporating Hemiptera into ecological studies examining forest management practices. We describe the contribution Hemiptera make as the fifth most speciose insect order to forest biodiversity, their functional role in ecosystems, and their role as forest pests. Hemiptera occur in all forest strata (e.g., soil, leaf-litter, understorey, overstorey). As abundant and diverse prey they are likely to contribute to the high diversity of other arthropods plus insectivorous birds, mammals and reptiles. Although most Hemiptera are herbivorous, the group exhibits a wide spectrum of feeding habits, including predators, fungivores, and parasites. Even within the herbivores there is great variation owing to different host specificity levels, with some species highly monophagous (feeding only from one species of plant), through to species that are highly polyphagous (feeding from different families of plants). As many polyphagous Hemiptera often target plants with high nutrients, individual plants within a species may also differ in their hemipteran assemblages owing to differences in nutrients. This diversity in trophic requirements means that Hemiptera are sensitive to changes not only in habitat structure, but also floristics and changes in plant chemistry. Similarly, seasonal changes can also influence the structure of hemipteran assemblages at spatial scales ranging from individual plants up to forest plots. We review the most efficient methods for sampling Hemiptera, for example, beating, pitfall traps, vacuum sampling, intercept traps and chemical knockdown. We examine current knowledge on the response and recovery of Hemiptera to different forest disturbances, such as fire, fragmentation, windthrow, disease and flood. We then illustrate these points by summarizing studies in a forest system being restored following the severe disturbance of mining. Finally, we detail the role that both introduced and native species of Hemiptera display as pests in forest or silvicultural systems, as outbreaks of Hemiptera can indicate when a system is stressed, particularly by drought or flooding. © 2007 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), the etiologic agent of West Nile Fever (WNF), an emerging infectious disease that lately has been rapidly extending its range of occurrence from Africa to Middle East, and to Asia and Southern Europe. In Europe, cases of isolating WNV from mosquitoes representing four genera have been reported from Romania, Portugal, France, southern Russia and what is the most important, from Poland's neighbouring countries as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and southern Ukraine. These data, as well as human and equine cases in the Czech Republic and Belarus, support hypothesis that WNV has already been present also in Poland, the more so, specific antibodies were detected in the sera of birds collected at the Kampinos and Bialowieza Primeval Forests and in human from the vicinity of Bialystok. Mosquitoes were collected in 2004-2009 at indoor and outdoor collection sites in districts: Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Mazowieckie, Podlaskie and Warmińsko-Mazurskie. In total 15400 female mosquitoes were collected in the cow sheds and overwintering in the cellars, and from human bait and CO2 traps. Mosquitoes were sorted by the collecting site, species and sex, and placed in pools of not in more than 50 specimens in special mixture of phenol and chaotropic salts and frozen in -20 degrees C. Altogether, 15400 females were examined. Total RNA were extracted according to protocol of A&A Biotechnology. RT reaction was performed with random primers and 217-nucleotide fragment from the NS5 coding sequence was amplified by heminested PCR. PCR products were analysed on 1.5% agarose gel. The predominant species was Culex pipiens, accounting for over 42% of total insects collection. All obtained results were negative. Further investigations are needed.

AB  - Limited stopover habitat along migration routes is a possible contributor to population declines in migratory landbirds. In highly fragmented agricultural landscapes, potential stopover sites are often limited to riparian corridor forests and small forest patches, but there are little quantitative data on stopover habitat selection in these areas, especially with regard to how migrants use isolated versus connected, and riparian versus upland, habitat patches. We examined the use of upland forest woodlots in the forest-agricultural landscape of northwest Indiana as stopover habitat, to determine whether migrants selected stopover sites on the basis of proximity to riparian corridor forest. In two spring and two fall seasons, we conducted 384 surveys in 12 small woodlots at three levels of isolation from a riparian forest corridor, detecting 3, 695 en-route migrants of 76 species. We detected no difference in migrant abundance or species richness among distance classes in either season, and a principal-component variable comprising several woodlot isolation metrics was not a significant contributor to migrant abundance in linear regression models. Fall migrant abundance was positively associated with early-successional forests containing fruiting trees and shrubs, whereas spring abundance was not associated with any vegetation characteristics. The lack of patterns of habitat occupancy at the landscape level suggests that migrants select stopover sites on the basis of local habitat characteristics such as food resources, regardless of the landscape context. Small, isolated woodlots composed largely of forest edge with high fruit and insect abundance may, therefore, be important conservation targets in highly fragmented landscapes where forest cover is limited. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2009.

AB  - South Africa's moist grassland harbours globally significant biodiversity, supplies essential ecosystem services, supports crop and livestock agriculture, forestry and settlement, yet is poorly conserved. Ongoing transformation and limited opportunity for expanding the protected area network require instead that biodiversity conservation is 'mainstreamed' within other land uses. This exercise sought to identify the relative compatibility of 10 land uses (conservation, livestock or game ranching, tourism/recreation, rural settlement, dryland cropping, irrigated cropping, dairy farming, plantation forestry, and urban settlement) with maintaining biodiversity integrity. This was assessed using 46 indicators for biodiversity integrity that covered landscape composition, structure, and functioning. Data was integrated into a single measure per land use through application of the analytic hierarchy process, with supporting information gained from interviews with experts. The rank order of importance amongst indicators was landscape structure, functioning and composition. Consistent differences among land uses for all three categories revealed two clear groupings. Conservation, livestock or game ranching had the lowest impact and retained substantial natural asset, while that for tourism/recreation was intermediate. All other land uses had a severe impact. Impact on biodiversity integrity depended mainly on the extent of transformation and fragmentation, which accounted for the greatest impact on habitats and species, and impairment of landscape functioning. It is suggested that a strategic intervention for maintaining biodiversity integrity of moist grassland is to support livestock or game ranching and limit ongoing urban sprawl. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Neotropical deciduous forests are threatened by anthropogenic activities and only a small area is protected against exploitation. In contrast to other Neotropical forest types, not much is known about the effect of habitat disturbance on deciduous forest bird communities. In the present study, we examine the effects of human disturbance on a deciduous forest bird community in the Andean foothills of Bolivia. Bird community composition was determined by means of point count surveys in three forest types, i.e. undisturbed deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, and disturbed forest habitat. Habitat disturbance was estimated indirectly by measuring vegetation structure variables in these forests. The effect of habitat disturbance was subsequently examined at bird community level (species richness, species abundance and diversity indices) and functional group level (habitat preference categories and foraging guild). Differences in community composition and reduced species abundance could clearly be related to habitat disturbance. However, results also indicated that sensitivity to disturbance varied among functional groups. Humid forest specialists showed the strongest response to habitat disturbance, predominantly bark-gleaning insectivores, canopy insectivores, understorey insectivores and ground-dwelling species, whereas dry forest specialists were not affected by disturbance. The present study suggests that anthropogenic disturbance negatively influenced the forest bird community in the investigated deciduous forest in Bolivia. This may indicate that conservation of both deciduous and semi-deciduous forest remnants is relevant for a diverse montane bird community in South America. Because various bird species typical of deciduous forests may also be able to survive in partly disturbed forests, conservation strategies should not only be focussed on the protection of pristine remnants but should also include secondary forest edge zones. © BirdLife International 2008.

AB  - Few urban studies of avian diversity discriminate between native and exotic species, although highly modified urban environments typically support significant numbers of non-native species. High overall diversity may mask poor native diversity. We identify which native species are successful in a variety of urban habitats in a New Zealand city, and examine the roles that garden size and complexity, native fragments, and vegetation composition and cover play in explaining variations in native and exotic avian diversity. Nearly half (44%) of 39 species recorded were exotic: four (three exotic and one native) comprised 45% of birds counted. While there was little variation between habitats in combined native and exotic species richness, the number and abundance of bush-dependent natives differed. Similarity measures identified three groups: (1) commercial, industrial and residential areas with small structurally simple gardens where 3-4 exotic species were numerically dominant and few bush natives made up <10% of the total count; (2) suburbs with medium/large gardens dominated by lawns, shrubs and trees, with many exotic species but also several bush natives (comprising 24-32% of the total count); and (3) bush fragments where both diversity and species richness of bush natives were highest (comprising 50-75% of the total count), including four insectivores absent from all residential areas. Vegetation structure, composition and cover, and proximity to fragments did not explain much of the variation in total or native species richness and diversity, but did explain 69% and 72% of bush-native species richness and abundance respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - I examined how High Andean insectivorous birds partition resources in remnant Polylepis forest patches at three locations in the Cordillera Vilcanota, southern Peru. A number of distinctive guilds were identified within the bird community based on the manner and location of foraging displayed by each species. Important dimensions that enabled differentiation amongst guild co-members were those that supported the partitioning of resources between guilds. The significant disproportionate use of substrates and prey-attack maneuvers by birds indicated substrate specialization within the insectivorous Polylepis bird community. These specializations provide a means by which Polylepis insectivores fit syntopically along a resource gradient. Insectivores demonstrated a differential response to foraging in smaller patches, and changes in the foraging regimes of four guilds between large and small patches were frequent. The most abundant insectivores in small patches were the least diverse foragers; they compensated behaviorally for changes in patch habitat quality by using fewer substrates and prey-attack maneuvers. Guild members that shifted their foraging regime to use fewer attack maneuvers were also more tolerant of small patches. Small Polylepis patches have a significant role in fragmented High-Andean ecosystem functioning by providing essential foraging habitat for insectivorous birds.

AB  - It is known that large fragment sizes and high connectivity levels are key components for maintaining species in fragments; however, their relative effects are poorly understood, especially in tropical areas. In order to test these effects, we built models for explaining understory birds occurrence in a fragmented Atlantic Rain Forest landscape with intermediate habitat cover (3%). Data from over 9000 mist-net hours from 17 fragments differing in size (2-175 ha) and connectivity (considering corridor linkages and distance to nearby fragments) were ranked under a model selection approach. A total 1293 individuals of 62 species were recorded. Species richness, abundance and compositional variation were mainly affected by connectivity indices that consider the capacity of species to use corridors and/or to cross short distances up to 30 m through the matrix. Bird functional groups were differently affected by area and connectivity: while terrestrial insectivores, omnivores and frugivores were affected by both area and connectivity, the other groups (understory insectivores, nectarivores, and others) were affected only by connectivity. In the studied landscape, well connected fragments can sustain an elevated number of species and individuals. Connectivity gives the opportunity for individuals to use multiple fragments, reducing the influence of fragment size. While preserving large fragments is a conservation target worldwide and should continue to be, our results indicated that connectivity between fragments can enhance the area functionally connected and is beneficial to all functional groups and therefore should be a conservation priority. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mixed-species foraging flocks of birds are found in many forest communities, both in temperate and tropical forests. Such flocks are typically highly structured in terms of foraging behavior, with different species occupying different foraging niches with respect to foraging positions and/or techniques. In the Neotropics, most studies have focused on species-rich flocks in lowland tropical forest, but little has been published on less diverse communities in montane Andean forests. We studied the composition and foraging behavior of birds in mixed insectivorous flocks in two small fragments of high-Andean Polylepis (Rosaceae) woodland near Cochabamba, Bolivia. One site represented largely undisturbed forest, while the other was more subject to anthropogenic influences due to clearing, grazing and small-scale agriculture inside the remaining forest. Flocks were small in both areas (4-5 individuals per flock), but flock composition differed markedly between the two sites. In the undisturbed site, flocks were dominated by Polylepis habitat specialists, while non-specialists were numerically dominant in the disturbed site. Species were clearly separated by foraging mode and preferred foraging substrate in the undisturbed site, but not so in the disturbed site. In the undisturbed site there was evidence for niche divergence between at least one pair of the main flocking species, while in the disturbed site some species tended to converge in foraging behavior when in each other's presence. It is concluded that both flock composition and flock structure in terms of niche separation differ markedly between the two sites, perhaps due to the lower abundance of specialist species in the disturbed site. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest (AF) is one of the five most threatened and megadiverse world hotspots. It is arguably the most devastated and highly threatened ecosystem on the planet. The vast scope of habitat loss and extreme fragmentation in the AF hotspots has left intact very few extensive and continuous forested fragments. We compared bird assemblages between small (<100 ha) and large (>6,000 ha) forest remnants, in one of the largest AF remnants in Argentina. We performed 84 point-counts of birds in four large fragments (LF) and 67 points in 25 small fragments (SF). We recorded 4,527 bird individuals belonging to 173 species; 2,632 belonging to 153 species in LF and 1,897 in 124 species in SF. Small fragments suffered a significant loss of bird richness, mainly forest dependent species, but the birds abundance did not decrease, due to an increase in abundance of forest independent and semi-dependent bird species (edge and non forest species) that benefit from forest fragmentation. The bird guilds of frugivores, undestory, terrestrial and midstory insectivores, nectarivores and raptors, and the endemic species of AF were area sensitive, decreasing significantly in richness and abundance in the SF. Terrestrial granivores were the only guild positively affected by forest fragmentation, containing mainly edge species, which forage in open areas or borders including crops. Our first observations on fragmentation effects on bird assemblages in the southernmost Argentinean Atlantic Forests did not validate the hypothesis on pre-adaptation to human disturbances in the bird communities of AF. On the contrary, we observed that forest dependent, endemic and several sensitive bird guilds were strongly affected by fragmentation, putting in evidence the vulnerability to the fragmentation process and the necessity to conserve large remnants to avoid reduction of the high biodiversity of AF birds. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The fact that species vary in their vulnerability to extinction is well documented, but the reasons for these differences remain poorly understood. Why should some species/families/guilds decline rapidly with increasing anthropogenic disturbance, while others either tolerate or proliferate in disturbed habitats? We investigated the bird species composition in 31 primary forest patches of varying size in a region of the Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' and assessed which species life-history traits predisposed individual species to extinction. Medium-sized non-flocking canopy frugivores/ominvores of low primary forest dependence were least likely to go extinct in small patches, while small-bodied flock-following primary-forest-dependent terrestrial insectivores were most fragmentation sensitive. We found highly idiosyncratic relationships between the minimum size of forest patches occupied by different species and their territory size requirements estimated based on other Amazonian studies. This suggests that avian assemblages in forest fragments primarily comprise species that either have good dispersal abilities or are highly tolerant to the non-forest matrix, rather than those whose minimum spatial requirements can be met by the size of available forest fragments. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding the impact of losing trophic diversity has global significance for managing ecosystems as well as important theoretical implications for community and ecosystem ecology. In several tropical forest ecosystems, habitat fragmentation has resulted in declines and local extinctions of mammalian and avian terrestrial insectivores. To assess the ability of a tropical rainforest community in Ivory Coast to resist perturbation from such loss of trophic diversity, I traced feedbacks in above and below ground communities and measured changes in nutrient levels and herbivory rates in response to an experimental exclosure of avian and mammalian terrestrial insectivores. I present evidence that loss of this functional group may result in increased tree seedling herbivory and altered nutrient regimes through changes in the abundance and guild structure of invertebrates. Exclusion of top predators of the forest floor resulted in increased seedling herbivory rates and macro-invertebrate (>5 mm) densities with strongest effects on herbivorous taxa, spiders and earthworms. Densities of microbivores including Collembola, Acarina and Sciaridae showed the opposite trend as did levels of inorganic phosphorus in the soil. Results were evaluated using path analysis which supported the presence of a top down trophic cascade in the detrital web which ultimately affected turnover of phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in tropical soils. Results illustrate the potential importance of vertebrate predators in both above and belowground food webs despite the biotic diversity and structural heterogeneity of the rainforest floor. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Riparian forests protect many species of plants and animals. We studied bird communities in riparian forest belts of the Sesesmiles river microwatershed, Copan, Honduras (140° 43' 12'' - 140° 58' 35'' N, 88° 53' 23'' - 89° 14' 17'' W). The main goal was to explore the effects of belt breadth on the richness and abundance of avian species visiting these forests. We selected 20 belts, and randomly established 30 observation points to monitor bird presence in the dry (March-April 2005) and rainy (June-July 2005) season (N= 60 observations). A total of 1 294 birds belonging to 145 species were recorded. Bird diversity was significantly correlated to the breadth of the riparian belts, with a greater number of species and individuals in belts 50 m wide or wider. Insectivorous and nectarivorous birds were the most abundant guilds. All bird species identified depend to some degree on riparian forests and are affected by belt breadth. Riparian belts over 50 m should be kept or established in order to conserve bird populations within agricultural and fragmented landscapes in similar tropical areas.

AB  - The Banded Ground-cuckoo (Neomorphus radiolosus) is a rare, endangered, and poorly known species endemic to the Choco Biogeographic Zone. We summarize 7 months of data from radio tracking an adult in northwestern Ecuador. Home range estimates were 42.2 ha (minimum convex polygon) and 49.9 ha (95% kernel analysis); the core area was 3.4 ha (50% kernel analysis). The bird favored undisturbed habitat and avoided secondary forest. It was primarily insectivorous and rarely associated with army ants (Eciton sp.) and not with mammals. Breeding occurred from March through June and the marked bird was seen with an unmarked individual throughout the study. The Banded Ground-cuckoo has a large home range, limited dispersal ability, and apparently depends on undisturbed forest. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation appear to be the gravest threats facing the species.

AB  - Birds play several roles in agricultural lands and respond to habitat heterogeneity within the agricultural landscape. Agricultural intensification in Argentina has increased the sown area, mainly with soybean, fragmenting landscapes in the pampas and mesopotamic region. In Entre Ríos Province, the original Espinal forest has been fragmented, leaving remnant patches of natural vegetation, in cases modified by cattle grazing. These changes represent a potential threat for avian conservation. In Entre Ríos, terraces may be a useful habitat in maintaining avian diversity, similar to other non-cropped linear habitats in agricultural landscapes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity created by terraces would maintain higher species richness and densities of avian species that use original or modified forests within cropped areas compared to fields without terraces. The study was carried out in soybean fields with an adjacent forest and either herbaceous, shrub or no terraces in two periods (March-April 2004). Birds were surveyed using line transects in field interior and edge, and observations were carried out in one forest remnant adjoining each field. Most bird species recorded in soybean fields were insectivorous or consume invertebrates during the breeding season. Species richness, total bird density and the density of granivores, insectivores and omnivores were higher in fields with terraces than in fields without terraces. Moreover, shrub terraces had higher effect on species richness and bird density than herbaceous terraces. Our results suggest that terraces may serve as a possible tool for maintaining avian diversity in agroecosystems in Entre Ríos.

AB  - In the vegetation corridors that connect small remnants of undisturbed primary forest in the Lavras landscape (Brazil), Protium spruceanum is a representative of a mass-flowering insect-pollinated and bird-dispersed tree. Allozyme variation was quantified from five forest remnants (N = 150) from secondary vegetation corridors linking them (N = 80) to generate information for genetic conservation. The species adhered to H-W equilibrium in all fragments in most of the loci. The results indicated high gene diversity in the fragments (Ĥ e=0.381-0.507) and corridors (Ĥ e=0.336-0. 470), positively correlated with the plant density (r = 0.742, R 2 = 0.551, d.f. = 4). We did not find evidence of inbreeding within fragments (f̂=-0.188, P&lt;0.05) nor overall (F̂=-0.101, P&lt;0.05). The genetic differentiation among remnants was low (θ̂p=2.8%). Evidence of recent bottlenecks by anthropogenic disturbance was detected in fragments (P &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon sign-rank test). The minimal viable population was estimated for conservation in situ, indicating fragments with possibilities of maintaining genetic equilibrium diversity in the short term (except F3) and in the long term (only F5). The N̂ e/N ratios was also calculated to contribute to vegetation enrichment, area recovery or creation of new vegetation corridors. We found high levels of gene diversity in the vegetation corridors, genetic identity with the fragments and absence of inbreeding. Thus, our results suggest that landscape management strategies should therefore consider both the creation of new vegetation corridors and the protection of extant ones. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical forests are difficult to separate, as they usually occur concurrently. In the state park La Sierra, in Tabasco, Mexico, the rainforest is being cleared for pasture, and fragments are being used by local inhabitants. This study examined the response of bird feeding guilds to habitat characteristics, including human disturbance, in five fragments of different sizes (1 ∼ 4,500 ha, 2 ∼ 150 ha, and 2 ∼ 80 ha). Using point count observations, 125 species were recorded and were grouped into 11 feeding guilds. As expected, the largest fragment had higher species richness and abundances than the smaller fragments. However, five habitat features differed significantly among fragment sizes, including tree density, the number of tree stumps and the number of trails. Thus the larger fragment was also less disturbed. Fragment size alone was significant only for scavenger species richness, and for the abundance of bark gleaning insectivores and insectivore/nectarivores. Raptors were more diverse and abundant in the large fragment and less disturbed sites. Arboreal frugivores and bark or foliage gleaning insectivores, depended on higher trees and less disturbed sites. A better understanding of the mechanisms that affect persistence is essential for the planning of conservation actions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine seasonal frugivory by two sympatric peccary species (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) in a small (2178 ha), Atlantic Forest fragment on the inland plateau region of São Paulo State, Brazil. Fruit availability was determined with systematic ground surveys conducted over a 5-yr period. Examining fruit availability trends for dry and wet seasons, we found that species diversity was greater in the wet season, but the total number and dry mass of fruits were higher in the dry season. Fruit abundance in the dry season was due to one palm, 'jeriva' (Syagrus romanzoffiana), which could be considered a keystone species at Caetetus Ecological Station as it also supported a diverse array of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. White-lipped peccaries were the only ungulates that ate palmito fruits (Euterpe edulis) at Caetetus. They consumed ripe and unripe fruits and predated the seeds by chewing the pulp and seed. This occurred primarily during the dry season and was associated with a seasonal range shift and a preference for palmito habitat by the white-lipped peccaries. The dominance of fruits in peccary diets (80% fruit items in scat) has management implications for other plateau forest fragments. Forest fragments with diminished fruit abundance or diversity, or lacking key species such as S. romanzoffiana or E. edulis, will not support the energetic requirements of the characteristically large and highly mobile white-lipped peccary populations. © 2007 The Author(s).

AB  - River Vistula, one of the large (1047 km in length) European rivers preserved in semi-natural, dynamic condition, is recognized as important corridor that enables birds and fishes to migrate for long distances. To test whether the Vistula valley provides corridor function also for mammals, field surveys and habitat modelling for six target species: Bank vole Myodes glareolus, Yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, Pine marten Martes martes, Beaver Castor fiber, Wild boar Sus scrofa, and Elk Alces alces, were undertaken in the 135 km long fragment of the valley from 529 (Warsaw) to 685 km (Włocławek). The data collected documented the occurrence of at least 51 mammals (5 Insectivora, 14 Chiroptera, 1 Lagomorpha, 16 Rodentia, 11 Carnivora, 4 Artiodactyla), and the highest species richness was noted in the fragment of river valley covered with mixed forests which makes up the protected area called Kampinos National Park. This protected area (385 km2) contains coniferous and mixed forests, inland dunes, wetlands, and mosaic of extensively used meadows, pastures, alder forests and fields. The LARCH (Landscape Ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat) (Van der Sluis and Romanowski 2005) model outputs indicated the potential for large viable populations of species analysed in the river valley. The LARCH SCAN analysis showed that habitats of modelled species were well connected and their local populations formed highly sustainable network. The spatial cohesion of habitats was generally highest in Kampinos NP and along the fragment of River Vistula from 580 to 618 km. It is concluded that high cohesion of habitats facilitates dispersion of animals and provides potential for gene flow among the populations in the valley. Riparian forests and islands are important for connecting the local populations of mammals of two river banks and are the key elements to provide functional continuity of the corridor along the river in places, where it is discontinued on one bank. The scenario analysis demonstrates potentially negative effects of river regulation and construction of two dams on viability of mammalian populations and spatial cohesion of their habitats. The future corridor function of the River Vistula valley depends mostly on preservation of it's dynamic, semi-natural condition.

AB  - Predation of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae by insectivorous avifauna was estimated on Lindera benzoin in edge and interior habitats at two sites in eastern Pennsylvania (USA). Clay baits modeled after Epimecis hortaria (Geometridae) larvae, the primary herbivore of L. benzoin at our study sites, were used to estimate predation by birds. In both habitat types, models were placed on uninjured L. benzoin leaves as well as on leaves that had prior insect herbivore damage. Rates of model attack were greater, and model longevity reduced, in forest edge plots compared to interiors. Naturally occurring herbivore damage on L. benzoin was greater in forest interiors. However, model attack was not significantly greater on leaves with prior herbivory damage, suggesting that birds do not effectively use this type of leaf damage as a cue in their foraging. Our findings are consistent with a contribution of bird predation towards top-down control of herbivory in this system. We further discuss these results in a broader context considering the possible effects of habitat type on leaf quality, leaf defense, and herbivore performance. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Habitat destruction and introductions of invasive species have been primary causes of endemic species loss on oceanic islands. This paper addresses the question of whether a reintroduced population of a critically endangered island endemic, the Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) is competing or co-existing with an exotic congener, the Madagascar fody (F. madagascariensis). We investigated habitat use and feeding ecology of the Mauritius fody during two early phases of its reintroduction onto a restored islet, and compared these parameters with the sympatric population of Madagascar fodies. The number of Mauritius fody territories increased from 4 to 20 in a seven month period following release, and overall mean territory area (c. 1 ha) was significantly larger than that of the more abundant Madagascar fody (c. 0.07 ha). The initial four territories were located in mature coastal forest, whilst those of the Madagascar fody were characterised by open canopy, smaller trees and grass-dominated ground cover. Mauritius fodies foraged mainly in dead leaves for insects, whilst the Madagascar fody fed primarily on the seeds of a native grass species. Mauritius fody territories later expanded to include a range of habitats. Differing ecological requirements indicate that divergence between these congeners may be sufficient for them to coexist and exploit contrasting resources on restored islets. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the long-term restoration of the Mauritius fody and other avian recovery programmes and highlight the critical importance of long-term post-release monitoring to assess the success of reintroduction to offshore islets as a long-term conservation strategy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Army ants (Formicidae: Ecitoninae) are top predators in neotropical forests. Army ant raids support a community of diverse organisms, including birds that attend the raids to collect prey. While elevation and forest fragmentation influence army ant and insectivorous bird communities, their effects on the interaction between army ants and bird species is unknown. We studied the size and species composition of bird flocks attending army ant swarms in forest fragments and continuous forest across an elevational gradient (1100-1680 m asl) in a neotropical montane region (Monteverde, Costa Rica). We observed a total of 41 bird species attending army ant swarms. Neither the number of birds, nor the total body mass of birds, nor the number of bird species in attending bird flocks was related to elevation. However, we found a higher bird species richness, larger flock size and greater total body mass of birds attending army ant swarms in continuous forest. Continuous and fragmented forest shared many attending bird species in common, but there was elevational segregation of attending bird species. Some montane endemic birds, and neotropical migrants, attend swarms regularly and use army ant raids as a food source. Copyright © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Theobroma cacao plantings, when managed under the shade of rainforest trees, provide habitat for many resident and migratory bird species. We compared the bird diversity and community structure in organic cacao farms and nearby forest fragments throughout mainland Bocas del Toro, Panama. We used this dataset to ask the following questions: (1) How do bird communities using cacao habitat compare to communities of nearby forest fragments? (2) To what extent do Northern migratory birds use shaded cacao farms, and do communities of resident birds shift their abundances in cacao farms seasonally? (3) Do small scale changes in shade management of cacao farms affect bird diversity? Using fixed radius point counts and additional observations, we recorded 234 landbird species, with 102 species that were observed in both cacao and forest fragments, 86 species that were only observed in cacao farms, and 46 species that were restricted to forest fragments. Cacao farms were rich in canopy and edge species such as tanagers, flycatchers and migratory warblers, but understory insectivores were nearly absent from cacao farms. We observed 27 migratory species, with 18 species in cacao farms only, two species in forest only, and seven species that occurred in both habitats. In cacao farms, the diversity of birds was significantly greater where there was less intensive management of the canopy shade trees. Shade tree species richness was most important for explaining variance in bird diversity. Our study shows that shaded cacao farms in western Panama provide habitat for a wide variety of resident and migratory bird species. Considering current land use trends in the region, we suggest that action must be taken to prevent conversion away from shaded cacao farms to land uses with lower biodiversity conservation value. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Assuming better colonization abilities of inferior competitors, the competition-colonization trade-off (CCTO) is one of the hypotheses that explains spatial variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Whereas this mechanism may structure some plant and insect communities, ecologists have failed to document its operation in other natural systems, and its generality has been questioned. We combined fieldwork and published data to study the composition of a guild of passerines (Parus cristatus, Parus montanus, Parus ater and Regulus regulus) inhabiting 10 landscapes that differed in the amount of forest habitat. The species were ordered in a stable, well-defined competitive hierarchy, and the dispersal ability of each species was inversely correlated with its position in this hierarchy. In functionally continuous landscapes, superior competitors occupied most fragments and all guild members commonly occurred. The relative incidences of superior and inferior competitors were reversed, and differences amplified, in landscapes where patches were physically (distance) or functionally (matrix hardness) isolated. We found little support for two competing hypotheses, namely reduced habitat quality in isolated patches and lower abundance of a keystone predator (Glaucidium passerinum) in fragmented landscapes. We concluded that the CCTO offered the most probable explanation for variation in the composition of the Parus guild across landscapes. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - Understory bird communities have been studied in a series of Amazonian rainforest fragments near Manaus, Brazil for about 20 years. Previous analysis of standardized mist-net samples revealed considerable temporal dynamism in capture rates, with communities in fragments responding to growth or cutting of the second growth matrix. This pattern was superimposed on expected fragment size effects among the 1-, 10-, and 100-ha fragments. Here we extend our earlier analysis of landscape effects by separately considering 1- and 10-ha fragments, with the goal of describing the recovery of bird communities in fragments surrounded by abandoned second growth. Most guilds, with the exception of terrestrial insectivores, appear to be on a trajectory to return to pre-isolation abundance in 10-ha fragments within about 40 years. Although some guilds showed similar recovery in 1-ha fragments, these were mostly species also common in second growth. Our results suggest that matrix development can allow bird communities to approach pre-isolation structure in fragments of at least 10 ha, but we emphasize that this conclusion represents a best-case scenario facilitated by the proximity to primary forest of the fragments we studied.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative survey of bird community were performed in two distinct semideciduous forest in the interior of the State of São Paulo from July 2004 to July 2005. Point Counts were used for the quantitative survey followed by diversity and frequence of ocurrence indexes of the bird assemblage. The qualitative survey registered a total of 181 species of birds at Fazenda Rio das Pedras (FRP, Itapetininga, 350 ha) and 126 at Fazenda Santa Maria II (FSM II, Buri, 260 ha). The qualitative survey registered 73 species in 998 contacts and 64 species en 1019 contacts, respectively, for FRP and FSM II. The ponctual index of abundance (IPA) varied from 0.01 (one contact) to 1.32 (132 contacts) at FRP and from 0.01 (one contact) to 0.97 (97 contacts) at FSM II. The general diversity index for FRP was H′ = 2.85 and H′ = 3.04 at FSM II. Both areas presented an evenness index of E = 0.91. The bird community in both patched of forest showed the same pattern found in other different forest fragments of relative size studies by many distinct authors. In both localities, insectivorus (53% at FSM e 50% at FRP) and frugivorus (23% na FSM e 26% na FRP) birds were the most representative. Among the former, Tyrannidae and Thamnophilidae were predominant, respectively, at FSM and FRP. In both places understory insectivorous birds were dominant (53% at FSM and 51,4% at FRP), followed by understory frugivorus at FSM (50%) and by canopy frugivorus (52,6%) at FRP.

AB  - Tropical birds may differ from temperate birds in their sensitivity to forest edges. We provide predictions about the proportions of tropical and temperate species that should avoid or exploit edges, and relationships between natural-history characters and edge responses. We conducted exploratory meta-analyses from 11 studies using 287 records of 220 neotropical and temperate species' responses to edges to address our predictions. A higher proportion of neotropical species were edge-avoiders compared with temperate species and a higher proportion of temperate species were edge-exploiters compared with neotropical species. Edge-avoiding responses were positively associated with being an insectivore for neotropical birds, and with being of small body mass and a latitudinal migrant for temperate birds. Temperate edge-exploiters were less likely to be insectivores and migrants than temperate birds that were not edge-exploiters. A greater proportion of neotropical birds than temperate birds may be at risk from forest fragmentation if edge-avoidance is a reasonable indicator of an inability to adapt to land-cover change. Future progress in our understanding of forest bird responses to edges is dependent upon greater standardization of methods and designing studies in the context of recent theoretical developments.

AB  - The influence of urbanization on nutrient cycling is vaguely known. Here we document that birds, especially those increasing in urban areas (such as crows, Corvus macrorhynchos and C. corone), affect nutrient cycles. Using fecal traps, we measured phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) input from the excrement of birds in fragmented forests in an urban landscape. Sources of avian feces were examined on the basis of carbon (C), N, and P percentages and stable isotopes of δ15N and δ13C. Nitrogen and P input was aggregated in the urban landscape, being especially high at the forest where crows roosted during winter. The annual P input due to bird droppings (range 0.068-0.460 kg·ha-1·yr-1; mean 0.167 kg·ha-1·yr-1) was 12.4% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 52.9% in the evergreen forest where crows roosted. The annual N input due to bird droppings (range 0.44-3.49 kg·ha-1·yr-1; mean 1.15 kg·ha -1·yr-1) was 5.2% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 27.0% in the evergreen forest used by roosting crows. Expected sources of nutrients in feces included insects in the breeding season, fruits in autumn, and mammals and birds in winter. Stable isotopes suggested that the source of nutrients in forests used by roosting crows was from outside the forest. Therefore, birds played a significant role as transporters of nutrients from garbage (including fish, livestock, and/or C4 plants such as corn, with high δ15N and δ13C) in residential and business areas to fragmented evergreen forests, especially near their winter roosts. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, frugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and postdispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover. Similarly, the magnitude of frugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - The overall aim of this study was to investigate structures of bird communities in remnants of fragmented box/cypress pine woodlands in central New South Wales, Australia, to guide habitat rehabilitation. The aims of the study were to: (1) determine how bird densities and species richness varied with remnant category; (2) determine how ranked densities of bird species varied by feeding group with remnant category; and (3) provide information on structures of bird communities in box/cypress pine woodlands to guide restoration. Structures of bird communities varied with remnant category. Large remnants had the most species whereas medium-sized and small remnants in low condition had the fewest. Bird densities increased with decreasing remnant area although densities did not differ significantly between remnant categories. Ranked bird densities varied between remnant categories, with relatively even distributions in large remnants in high condition, and uneven distributions in small remnants in low condition. Densities of small insectivores were much lower in small, low-condition remnants than in large, high-condition remnants. Densities of generalists such as noisy miner and galah showed the reverse pattern. The structures of bird communities in large remnants in good condition provide a reference state for assessing recovery of bird communities. © CSIRO 2007.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a major threat to tropical forests and understanding the ecological consequences of this disturbance is crucial for the conservation of biodiversity. There have been many attempts to determine the ecological traits associated with bird species' vulnerability to disturbance, but no attempt has been made to synthesize these studies to show consensus. We analyzed data from 57 published studies (covering 1214 bird species) that investigated the response of tropical bird assemblages to moderate forest disturbance (e.g., selective logging). Our results show that the mean abundance of species from six commonly reported feeding guilds responded differently to disturbance and that species' ecological traits (body size, local population size, and geographic range size) and evolutionary relationships may influence responses in some guilds. Granivore abundance increased significantly and insectivore and frugivore abundance decreased significantly following disturbance. These general conclusions were robust to the effects of ecological traits and phylogeny. Responses of carnivores, nectarivores, and omnivores were less clear, but analyses that accounted for phylogeny indicated that these guilds declined following disturbance. In contrast to the other guilds, the reported responses of carnivores and nectarivores differed among regions (Asia vs. Neotropics) and were influenced by the sampling protocols used in different studies (e.g., time since disturbance), which may explain the difficulty in detecting general responses to disturbance in these guilds. Overall, general patterns governed the responses of species to habitat disturbance, and the differential responses of guilds suggested that disturbance affects trophic organization and thus ecosystem functioning. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - The large intact areas of old-growth forest of the Archangelsk oblast represent today a possibility of studying taiga ecology in ecosystems that we do not find in Fennoscandia. They are to be regarded as the sources for the taiga-elements in our own coniferous forests. This study of bird communities was done in the core of one of the old remaining, intact forests of Archangelsk, alongside the Yula river in Pinega and Vinogradovsky rayons («regions»). Bird communities in mature spruce and pine dominated forests were studied in spring 2005. These communities from the core area of the taiga are compared with coniferous forest in the rural municipality of Lierne in eastern central Norway, studied in 2004. This latter area should be representative for the westernmost parts of the taiga. Due to extensive forestry exploitation and natural heterogeneity it is heavily fragmented, leaving behind only smaller fragments of more or less coherent old-growth stands. Findings in our comparison: • Species dependent on sufficient amount of dead wood, e.g. woodpeckers, comprise far less of the bird communities within the small-grained old-growth fragments in Lierne compared with the situation in the virgin taiga at Yula. • The abundance of all hole-nesters (including those using snags and cracks in the trunks) is considerably diluted in the bird community within the old-growth forest in Lierne compared with those found in the coniferous forests at Yula. • The assemblage forming the old-growth bird guild (predominately passerines) is still almost as abundant in the remaining fragments in Lierne as in the large block of taiga at Yula. As high abundance of hole-nesters might reflect the occurrence of several other vulnerable forest species among insects, vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens, our findings from the bird survey should also indicate a more general high conservation value of this large block of taiga at Yula.

AB  - We assessed the impacts of picnic areas on birds within adjacent eucalypt forests in the Brisbane region, Australia. Within the picnic areas there was an assemblage of relatively large, aggressive birds, including several generalist predators (Torresian crow, grey and pied butcherbirds, Australian magpie) as well as the noisy miner, resembling that found in suburban areas within the study region. Eight transects abutting picnic areas ("picnic area edges") were compared with two types of matched control transect within forest about 150 m away: "forest interiors", which were also distant from any other edge and "context references", which were similar to the picnic area edges in their proximity to the access roads and forest external edges. Bird assemblages at picnic area edges, which were dominated by the noisy miner and Australian magpie, clearly differed from those of forest interiors, which were characterised by a number of smaller bodied insectivorous species. Levels of artificial nest predation were several-fold greater adjacent to the picnic areas. Context reference transects were more often similar to forest interiors than to picnic area edges. We conclude that picnic areas exert strong localised edge effects on forest bird assemblages, and are likely to cause reduced reproductive success for small-bodied forest bird species which attempt to nest nearby. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Richness, composition and spatial distribution of birds were analyzed on an urban forest fragment of 47.3 ha at Maringá, Southern Brazil (23°25'S and 51°25W). Four habitats were categorized on this fragment: forest, forest edge, open areas and lagoon. The forest and forest edge were divided into three levels: understory (bellow 3 m), mid-levels (3-6 m) and canopy (above 6 m). A standard transect was ran throughout all pre-established habitats four times each month of January to December 2003, totaling 48 sampling days. A total of 86 bird species were registered on the forest fragment, being the insectivores and omnivores, respectively, the guilds with larger number of species. Most of the species was registered on no more than 25% of samplings. The forest was the habitat with largest species richness and largest percentage of species with occurrence frequency above of 75%. The mid-levels presented the largest species richness and the canopy the largest percentage of species with occurrence frequency above of 75%. It is pointed out the importance of conservation of the several urban forest fragments and the tree covering on Maringá, in order to minimize the isolation effects and to try to supply the needs of part of the bird community that possibly would not to persist on studied fragment whether there were not other near forest areas.

AB  - Positive effects of fragmentation on plant reproduction are uncommon; in a literature review we found significant negative effects on fruit or seed set for 50 plant species, compared to 26 species showing no effect, and only nine affected positively. One of these is the declining New Zealand mistletoe Peraxilla tetrapetala (Loranthaceae), and here we investigate the mechanism of this positive effect. P. tetrapetala requires visits from native bird or bee pollinators to produce fruit. Fruit set was consistently pollen limited at several South Island sites because of a shortage of pollinators, but within a site at Lake Ohau, plants on forest edges had higher fruit set than those in the forest interior. Previous work showed that this difference was not caused by a shortage of resources in interior plants, but was associated with higher bird visitation rates to flowers on edges. In this study, we tested whether native bees also show a preference for edge flowers. At two sites (Ohau and Craigieburn) edge mistletoes had higher visitation by native bees (Hylaeus agilis and Leioproctus sp.) and higher fruit set. Some, but not all, of the higher visitation to edge flowers was explained by a preference amongst bees for flowers in direct sunshine. Therefore, P. tetrapetala experiences higher fruit set on edges because both of its main groups of pollinators (endemic birds and bees) visit edge flowers more often. The other eight published cases of positive effects of fragmentation on fruit set also all reported increased visitation rates by pollinators. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

AB  - The rainforests of the Amazon basin are being cut by humans at a rate &gt;20,000 km2/year, leading to smaller and more isolated patches of forest, with remaining fragments often in the range of 1-100 ha. We analyzed samples of understory birds collected over 20 years from a standardized mist-netting program in 1- to 100-ha rainforest fragments in a dynamic Amazonian landscape near Manaus, Brazil. Across bird guilds, the condition of second growth immediately surrounding fragments was often as important as fragment size or local forest cover in explaining variation in abundance. Some fragments surrounded by 100 m of open pasture showed reductions in insectivorous bird abundance of over 95%, even in landscapes dominated by continuous forest and old second growth. These extreme reductions may be typical throughout Amazonia in small (≤10 ha), isolated fragments of rainforest. Abundance for some guilds returned to preisolation levels in 10- and 100-ha fragments connected to continuous forest by 20-year-old second growth. Our results show that the consequences of Amazonian forest loss cannot be accurately described without explicit consideration of vegetation dynamics in matrix habitat. Any dichotomous classification of the landscape into "forest" and "nonforest" misses essential information about the matrix. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Numerous studies have documented declines in plant diversity in response to habitat loss in fragmented landscapes. However, determining the mechanisms that lead to species loss is challenging using solely a correlative approach. Here we link correlative assessments of plant community composition with seed additions for a focal species to test the hypothesis that distributions of forests plants within a fragmented landscape are limited by seed dispersal. Woody plant species richness of fragments declined as fragments (n=26) became more isolated by agricultural fields. We predicted that if these isolation effects were driven by poor dispersal rather than other effects associated with habitat loss, then plants should vary in their response to isolation in relation to their seed size (i.e., stronger effects for plants with larger seeds). As predicted under this dispersal limitation hypothesis, sensitivity of bird-dispersed shrubs to isolation was related to their seed mass, with species with heavy seeds (e.g., Lindera benzoin) exhibiting stronger declines in presence across isolation gradients than species with light seeds. Seed addition experiments were performed for Lindera benzoin in two high isolation forest fragments (nearest neighbor mean distance=803 m) where Lindera was naturally absent, and two low isolation fragments (nearest neighbor mean distance=218 m) with naturally occurring Lindera populations. Seed addition and control plots (n=50 1 m2 plots per fragment) were monitored for 13 censuses over 3 years. Across all four fragments, seed additions resulted in significant increases in Lindera seedling recruitment with no differences in final seedling establishment among fragments. However, insect herbivory was higher on Lindera seedlings in high isolation compared to low isolation fragments and was negatively correlated with seedling survival over some years. Consistent with prior work, our results confirm that seed dispersal plays a significant role in affecting plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. However, results also suggest the need for a better understanding of how additional processes, such as herbivory, may be altered as habitat is lost and what effects such changes have for forest plants. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Periodic partial harvesting of trees is an important economic activity within the highly fragmented woodlands of southern Ontario. We studied the population density, age structure, food abundance, productivity, and nest survival of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus) nesting in 35 deciduous woodlots with varying intensities of harvest. Heavily cut woodlots contained higher densities of territorial males and greater abundances of fruit-bearing shrubs compared with standard cut and reference sites (uncut for >13 years). Results based on insect sampling were mixed, depending on the sampling technique and sample date. All treatments were demographic sinks, with populations in this landscape showing annual declines of 19%-24%. Though the proportion of parasitized nests tended to be higher in heavily cut sites, harvesting had little effect on nest survival, nest initiation dates, clutch size, age structure, or the number of young fledged from a successful nest. Our results indicate that within the fragmented woodlots of southern Ontario, partial harvesting does not further degrade breeding habitat for Rose-breasted Grosbeaks. However, further research is needed to determine the underlying causes of population declines. © 2006 NRC.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation modifies ecological patterns and processes through changes in species richness and abundance. In the coastal Maulino forest, central Chile, both species richness and abundance of insectivorous birds increases in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. Through a field experiment, we examined larvae predation in fragmented forests. Higher richness and abundance of birds foraging at forest fragments translated into more insect larvae preyed upon in forest fragments than in continuous forest. The assessed level of insectivory in forest fragments agrees with lower herbivory levels in forest fragments. This pattern strongly suggests the strengthening of food interactions web in forest fragments of coastal Maulino forest. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - Cloud forests in central Guatemala are fragmented and decreasing in area due to slash-and-burn agricultural activities. We studied bird species composition, abundance, guild composition, and site tenacity of a 102 ha plot located in a cloud forest region of the Sierra Yalijux in Guatemala, half of which was primary forest and half young secondary forest (<7-years-old). Of the 100 species present 14 were restricted to the Endemic Bird Area 'Northern Central American highlands' (i.e. 66% of a total of 21 endemics). Five of the 100 analysed species, including one of the restricted-range species (Troglodytes rufociliatus), had a significantly different abundance in primary and secondary forests. Theoretical analysis suggests that seven species out of a community comprised of 141 bird species are already extirpated and only three out of the 14 present restricted-range species might survive the current state of deforestation. Insectivores were the dominant guild on the plot in terms of numbers of species, followed by omnivores, frugivores and granivores. However, in terms of individuals, omnivores made up nearly half of the bird individuals in primary forest, but declined by 44% in secondary forest, whereas granivores more than doubled in this habitat type. Numbers of species per guild were not significantly different between habitats, while numbers of individuals per guild were significantly different. In general, individuals per species are significantly different in the two habitats. Results suggest that most of the species that are currently surviving in the remnant forests of the Sierra Yalijux might be fairly well adapted to a range of forest conditions, but that populations of a number of restricted-range species might be small. Even generalists species like the Common Bush Tanager (Chlorospingus ophthalmicus) are less abundant in secondary vegetation than in primary forest of the study plot. © Springer 2006.

AB  - I tested whether terrestrial/understory habits, large body sizes, low tolerance to edge or to matrix habitat, and food/habitat specialization are characteristics of the most vulnerable bird species based on point counts conducted in 14 forest fragments in northern Paraná, southern region of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In addition, the sensitivity level of each bird species to forest fragmentation in northern Paraná (high, medium, and low) was compared to the Viçosa region, another fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest. Contrary to expectations, large body size and terrestrial/understory habits were not features clearly related to high sensitivity to forest fragmentation; but species with tolerance to edge did have lower sensitivity. I found also that specialized habitat/food were not good predictors of extinctions; the most specialized guilds, bamboo and vine-tangle insectivores and trunk and twig insectivores, had a high number of species with low sensitivity. Patterns of sensitivity were compared for 75 bird species that occurred in both northern Paraná and Viçosa; higher incongruence occurred for 14 and 7 species considered as highly sensitive in Viçosa but were of medium or low sensitivity, respectively, in northern Paraná. These differences may occur because sensitivity to habitat fragmentation may vary from the center to the periphery of a species' geographic range. Geographic variation in patterns of sensitivity to forest fragmentation may be important for conservation planning. © 2005 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - Since 1960, most of the forest surrounding the La Selva Biological Station, an intensively studied tropical research facility in Costa Rica, has been converted to agricultural uses. We used quantitative censuses and analysis of previously published categorical abundances to assess changes in the bird community, and we evaluated potential causes of species-specific changes by assessing their association with habitat, diet, participation in mixed-species flocks, and nest type. Approximately the same percentage of species increased as decreased in abundance from 1960 to 1999 (10-20% of all species, depending on method of assessment). Diet was the single most important trait associated with declining species. At least 50% of the species that declined have insectivorous diets. Use of forest habitat and participation in mixed-species flocks were also significant factors associated with declines, but nest type was unrelated to change in abundance. The species that increased in abundance tended to occur in open habitats and have omnivorous diets. These results reinforce the importance of several population risk factors associated with tropical understory insectivory and mixed-species flocking: patchy spatial distribution, low population density, large home range, and dietary specialization. La Selva's protected area (1611 ha), despite a forested connection on one boundary with a higher elevation national park, is apparently too small to maintain at least one major guild (understory insectivores). This first quantitative assessment of bird community change at La Selva highlights the need to intensify study of the mechanisms and consequences of biological diversity change in tropical forest fragments. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Territory size is an important ecological attribute of populations that has been considered a factor determines population density. Antbirds is a large group of mainly insectivorous Neotropical passerines, usually well represented in bird communities from forested landscapes in Neotropical region. Territory sizes for three Antbirds, Thamnophilus caerulescens (Vieillot, 1816) (Variable Antshrike), Dysithamnus mentalis (Temmink, 1823) (Plain Antvireo) e Pyriglena leucoptera (Vieillot, 1818) (White-shouldered Fire-eye), were mapped and their area estimated by the convex polygon method in a 50 ha forest fragment, in southeastern Brazil. The three species presented small territories of similar sizes (≤ 2 ha) both during the non-reproductive and the reproductive seasons of 2000-2001. Territories overlapped considerably among species but not intraspecifically. Territory sizes increased with body mass of the three species studied (P. leucoptera > T. caerulescens > D. mentalis). We failed to find any effect on territory size for the three species associated with forest edge or distance to the dirt road.

AB  - We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.

AB  - The influence of matrix habitats on the occurrence of seven understory insectivorous bird species in forest fragments was examined at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Manaus, Amazonia. Playback techniques were used to detect individuals in the continuous primary forest, fragments of 1, 10 and 100 ha, and in two matrix habitats of secondary forest dominated by Vismia spp. and Cecropia spp. Sampling points in secondary forest areas were distributed at 50, 250 and 500 m from the continuous forest. Using G-tests of frequency distribution, species occurrences were compared in the following ways: (a) continuous forest vs. fragments; (b) continuous forest vs. second growth forest; (c) in second growth at different distances from continuous forest. Species were divided into three categories according to their sensitivity to the fragmentation process. Highly sensitive species (Cyphorhinus arada, Hylophilus ochraceiceps and Thamnomanes ardesiacus) did not occur in small fragments or in matrix habitats. Moderately sensitive species (Formicarius colma and T. caesius) occurred in small fragments and utilized infrequently matrix habitats. Positively affected species (Percnostola rufifrons and Hypocnemis cantator) were frequently detected in small fragments and all matrix habitats. Distances from the continuous forest did not influence the frequency of species occurrences in the secondary forest areas. Species were more frequent in small fragments surrounded by Cecropia spp. than by Vismia spp. Our results support the idea that the maintenance of species in small fragments may depend on their ability to use the matrix, and that increasing the permeability of the matrix may be an option to lessen the effects of forest fragmentation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The microscopical examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and a nested PCR were performed to detect avian Plasmodium in 275 passerine birds from small and large fragments of Atlantic Forest, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The 275 blood smears were used both for the microscopical examination and nested PCR providing the DNA template used for the reactions. The sensitivity of the nested PCR assay was higher than that observed for blood smears through microscopical examination. High prevalence (39-6%) of Plasmodium infections was detected by nested PCR while the microscopical examination detected only 16-5% positive birds. Poor agreement was observed between the results of the two different tests. The PCR data obtained were correlated to the forest fragment size of the Atlantic Forest and also correlated to the biological characteristics of the birds (nest type construction, diet, participation in mixed-species flocks, age and sex). Birds captured in the large forest areas were more infected than birds captured in the small areas (51-9% and 28-5%, respectively). Diet and participation in mixed-species flocks were correlated to the Plasmodium parasitism. The insectivorous birds and those that participated in mixed-species flocks were more frequently infected (47% and 41-5%, respectively) than the other groups. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In an ecological community, groups of species may or may not have a nested structure. Furthermore, any nested structure detected could have several causes, each of which would have to be identified, since they may have important theoretical and management implications. In this paper, I assessed the nested structure of bird communities using cloud forest fragments in eastern Mexico to identify bird species and groups of species sensitive to cloud forest fragmentation. Sensitive species were expected to have a nested arrangement highly correlated with forest fragmentation intensity. Analysis identified the following groups of birds as showing a nested structure highly correlated with cloud forest fragmentation: birds with a body mass between 100 and 300 g and larger than 600 g, some trophic behavioural guilds (terrestrial granivore, terrestrial granivore-frugivore, understory granivore-frugivore, arboreal granivore-frugivore, gleaning terrestrial insectivore, gleaning understory insectivore, cliff gleaning insectivore, nocturnal aerial insectivore, diurnal raptor, nocturnal raptor, terrestrial omnivore, scavenger), forest interior and generalist birds, species restricted to cloud forest, and threatened species. This study shows that the analysis of the nested species assemblage can be considered a useful tool to identify species sensitivity to ecological or landscape patterns and processes, in this case, species or groups of species affected by a fragmented landscape pattern.

AB  - The rock fowl is an endangered species and its food and feeding ecology was studied in the forest zone of Old Oyo National Park, Nigeria. The methods used were direct observation, and fragmentation analysis of faecal and crop content of samples collected during both the wet and dry seasons. The results showed that rock fowl feed on a wide range of species of insects, fruits and flower buds. In the wet season, animal resources represented 54 and 62% of the adult and chick diet, respectively, whereas in the dry season, animal food resources represented about 60% of both adult and the chick diets. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the food composition of the birds between the dry and wet seasons. There was also a significant (P < 0.05) difference in food preference between adults and chicks. Food sharing was not common, although it was observed between rock fowl cockerels and hens. Food search and selection indices were directly related to season and food availability. It was concluded that food scarcity may not be a serious contributory factor in the threat to the rock fowl. © 2005 African Journal of Ecology.

AB  - We studied the importance of fragment size and structural and functional connectivity on the occurrence and abundance of seven Atlantic Forest bird species in 13 patches (13-275 ha) and three sites within a continuous forest (10,000 ha). We sampled birds with point counts and evaluated structural connectivity considering the presence of corridors and the degree of isolation. We defined functional connectivity by analyzing species movements using playbacks in forest corridors between fragments and in the surrounding matrix. Species differed in their responses to fragmentation. For the frugivorous species, Trogon surrucura, Carpornis cucullatus and Triclaria malachitacea, patch size was the main factor determining abundance. Two understory insectivorous species, Basileuterus leucoblepharus and Pyriglena leucoptera, were more affected by the degree of patch connectivity, the former by the presence of corridors and the latter by the distance between patches. The capacity of P. leucoptera to use corridors and open areas (i.e. functional connectivity) shaped its abundance pattern. Fragmentation had no effect on the abundance of Chiroxiphia caudata and had a positive effect on Batara cinerea. This study emphasizes the importance of considering species' perceptions of landscape, especially functional connectivity, in understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forests are being lost at an alarming rate. Studies from various tropical locations report losses of forest birds as possibly direct or indirect results of deforestation. Although it may take a century for all the sensitive species to be extirpated from a site following habitat loss, species with larger or heavier bodies and those foraging on insects, fruits, or both are particularly extinction prone. Larger- or heavier-bodied species may occur at low densities, increasing their vulnerability to habitat alterations. Insectivores are vulnerable for reasons such as the loss of preferred microhabitats, poor dispersal abilities, and/or ground nesting habits that make them susceptible to predation. The lack of year-round availability of fruits may make survival in deforested or fragmented areas difficult for frugivores. Extirpation of large predators, superior competitors, pollinators, and seed dispersers may have repercussions for tropical ecosystem functioning. Large tropical reserves that adequately protect existing forest avifauna are needed. Sound ecological knowledge of tropical forest avifauna for biodiversity-friendly forest management practices is also needed but sorely lacking.

AB  - Aim: Madagascar's lowland forests are both rich in endemic taxa and considered to be seriously threatened by deforestation and habitat fragmentation. However, very little is known about how these processes affect biodiversity on the island. Herein, we examine how forest bird communities and functional groups have been affected by fragmentation at both patch and landscape scales, by determining relationships between species richness and individual species abundance and patch and landscape mosaic metrics. Location: Littoral forest remnants within south-eastern Madagascar. Methods: We sampled 30 littoral forest remnants in south-eastern Madagascar, within a landscape mosaic dominated by Erica spp. heathland. We quantified bird community composition within remnants of differing size, shape and isolation, by conducting point counts in November-December in 2001 and October-November 2002. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, remnant shape, isolation, and surrounding landscape complexity. We used stepwise regression to test the relationship between bird species richness and landscape structural elements, after correcting for sampling effort. Relationships between bird species abundances and the landscape variables were investigated with Canonical Correspondence Analysis and binomial logistic regression modelling. Results: Bird species richness and forest-dependent bird species richness were significantly (P < 0.01) explained by remnant area but not by any measure of isolation or landscape complexity. The majority of forest-dependent species had significant relationships with remnant area. Minimum area requirements for area-sensitive species ranged from 15 to 150 ha, with the majority of species having area requirements > 30 ha. Surprisingly, there was no relationship between bird body size and minimum area requirement. Forest-dependent canopy insectivorous species and large canopy frugivorous species were the most sensitive functional groups, with > 90% species sensitivity within each group. The distribution of four forest-dependent species also appeared to be related to remnant shape where remnant area was < 100 ha. Main conclusions: The majority of forest-dependent species, including many that are considered widespread and common, were found to have significant relationships with fragment size, indicating that they are sensitive to processes associated with habitat loss and fragmentation. As deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain serious problems on the island, it follows that many forest-dependent bird species will decline in abundance and become locally extinct. At the regional scale, we urge that large (> 200 ha) blocks of littoral forest are awarded protected status to preserve their unique bird community.

AB  - Depending on the mosaic of habitats that is created, forest fragmentation can reduce the abundance and diversity of forest birds. Temperate deciduous forests in South America are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations, causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds. We examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas: a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest, forest fragments and pine plantations. Four species were negatively affected by fragmentation, with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations. Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest. The abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve, but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations. Thus, forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology. © 2004 FFI.

AB  - Bird communities were studied in two types of fragmented habitat of Atlantic forest in the State of Paraná, southern Brazil; one consisted of forest fragments that were created as a result of human activities (forest remnants), the other consisted of a set of naturally occurring forest fragments (forest patches). Using quantitative data obtained by the point counts method in 3 forest patches and 3 forest remnants during one year, species richness and relative abundance were compared in those habitats, considering species groups according to their general feeding habits. Insectivores, omnivores, and frugivores presented similar general tendencies in both habitats (decrease of species number with decreasing size and increasing isolation of forest fragment). However, these tendencies were different, when considering the relative abundance data: the trunk insectivores presented the highest value in the smallest patch while the lowest relative abundance was in the smallest remnant. In the naturally fragmented landscape, time permitted that the loss of some species of trunk insectivores be compensated for the increase in abundance of other species. In contrast, the remnants essentially represented newly formed islands that are not yet at equilibrium and where future species losses would make them similar to the patches.

AB  - Sustainable forest restoration and management practices require a thorough understanding of the influence that habitat fragmentation has on the processes shaping genetic variation and its distribution in tree populations. We quantified genetic variation at isozyme markers and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in severely fragmented populations of Sorbus aucuparia (Rosaceae) in a single catchment (Moffat) in southern Scotland. Remnants maintain surprisingly high levels of gene diversity (HE) for isozymes (H E = 0.195) and cpDNA markers (HE = 0.490). Estimates are very similar to those from non-fragmented populations in continental Europe, even though the latter were sampled over a much larger spatial scale. Overall, no genetic bottleneck or departures from random mating were detected in the Moffat fragments. However, genetic differentiation among remnants was detected for both types of marker (isozymes Θn = 0.043, cpDNA Θc = 0.131; G-test, P-value &lt; 0.001). In this self-incompatible, insect-pollinated, bird-dispersed tree species, the estimated ratio of pollen flow to seed flow between fragments is close to 1 (r = 1.36). Reduced pollen-mediated gene flow is a likely consequence of habitat fragmentation, but effective seed dispersal by birds is probably helping to maintain high levels of genetic diversity within remnants and reduce genetic differentiation between them.

AB  - In and out of mists and clouds of the high Andes of Bolivia appears an unexpected sight: patches of otherworldly trees and bushes surviving the harsh climate 4,000 meters above sea level. Called queñua by Andean natives, these members of the genus Polylepis are the highest growing trees in the world, and their distinctive appearance highlights the many adaptations necessary to survive at considerable altitude in the cordilleras of South America. Species of Polylepis differ markedly from one another having specialized for very different habitats: Some grow on the cold and wet eastern flank of the Andes above the expansive Amazon Basin, whereas others eke out an existence in the high and arid western side, which slopes down into the Atacama desert. Because of the isolation of this amazing ecosystem, a wide range of animals, particularly birds and insects, has evolved close connections with the Polylepis trees, creating a fascinating and distinctive community. Despite the uniqueness and fragility of the Polylepis ecosystem, it long remained poorly studied because early investigators believed that the patchy occurrence of Polylepis groves was a natural phenomenon, thus raising no alarms for its longevity. The German botanist Heinz Ellenberg challenged this notion in the 1950s. He claimed that much of the high Andes would naturally be covered with Polylepis and that the current restricted distribution of the Polylepis forests was the result of thousands of years of human activities. The finding that once-extensive natural Polylepis forest has been artificially fragmented by occupants of the Andes for 5,000 years-and is, in fact, highly threatened-has completely changed the perception of researchers and conservationists. Early investigators predicted that Polylepis would grow only on boulder fields and steep slopes because of some advantageous ecological conditions, such as warmer ground temperatures or decreased wind. Further study has shown that the remaining patches are not restricted to any single type of terrain, but rather have survived in sites that are less accessible to brush fire and grazing animals. The initial studies by Fjeldså and Kessler were successful in bringing attention to this increasingly endangered ecosystem. As a result, biologists have now fully documented the 20 types of queñua and continue to discover among them new bird and insect species. Currently, several research and conservation projects focus on Polylepis throughout the tropical Andes, many of them being carried out by local investigators rather than by foreigners.

AB  - Despite the fact that Madagascar is classified a biological 'hotspot' due to having both high levels of species endemism and high forest loss, there has been no published research on how Madagascan bird species respond to the creation of a forest edge or to degradation of their habitat. In this study, we examined how forest bird communities and different foraging guilds were affected by patch habitat quality and landscape context (forest core, forest edge and matrix habitat) in the threatened littoral forests of coastal southeastern Madagascar. We quantified habitat use and community composition of birds by conducting 20 point counts in each landscape contextual element in October and November 2002. We found that littoral forest core habitats had significantly (p<0.01) more bird species than forest edge and matrix habitats. Thirty-one (68%) forest dependent species were found to be edge-sensitive. Forest edge sites had fewer species, and a higher representation of common species than forest interior sites. Twenty-nine species were found in the matrix habitat, and the majority of matrix-tolerant forest species had their greatest abundance within littoral forest edge habitats. Guild composition also changed with landscape context. Unlike other tropical studies with which we are familiar, we found that frugivorous species were edge-sensitive while sallying insectivores were edge-preferring. The majority of canopy insectivores (n=15, 88%), including all six endemic vanga species, were edge-sensitive. When habitat quality was assessed, the distributions of nine edge-sensitive species were significantly (p<0.01) affected by changes in habitat complexity and vegetation vertical structure in core or edge point counts. Therefore, we believe that changes in vegetation structure at the edge of littoral forest remnants may be a key indicator of mechanisms involved in edge sensitivity of forest dependent species in these forests. Our findings indicate that habitat fragmentation and degradation affect Madagascan bird communities and that these processes threaten many species. With continued deforestation and habitat degradation in Madagascar, we predict the further decline of many bird species. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the lowland tropical rain forest of central Amazonia, I investigated the responses of understory bird communities to forest edges bordering a narrow (<40 m width), unpaved road. From 3681 mist-net captures, bird abundance and composition were examined at three distances (10, 70, and 130 m) from forest edge. The degree to which regrowth vegetation along forest borders reduced edge effects was also assessed by contrasting bird communities near roads with varying levels of regrowth. Forests near road margins had reduced canopy cover and height and higher numbers of fallen trees than did forest interiors. Bird communities near forest edges also differed markedly from those in forest interiors. Total bird captures and captures of insectivores increased with distance from edge, whereas captures of frugivores and nectarivores did not vary significantly. Mature regrowth on edges significantly increased the captures of insectivores. When insectivorous birds were divided into feeding guilds, birds in six of eight guilds showed significant responses to distance from edge; five of these had fewer captures near road margins whereas one guild (edge/gap specialists) had higher captures. For most guilds, significant alterations in abundance and species composition were evident within 10-70 m of road margins. My results suggest that the majority of Amazonian understory birds respond negatively to artificial edges created by a narrow, unpaved road. Forest regrowth along road margins alleviated negative edge effects for only a limited subset of forest-dependent species.

AB  - Pollen-and/or nectar-feeding lorikeets and bats and nectar-feeding honeyeaters, while less frequent visitors to eucalypt flowers than insects, may make a unique contribution to eucalypt population structure because of their capacity to move pollen large distances. Birds and bats may travel upwards of 50 km day-1 during feeding, and further during migration or feeding bouts over several days. Limited data suggest that they carry viable pollen. Several eucalypts have adaptations favouring bird pollinators, while some species, particularly Corymbia spp., have adaptations commonly found among plants pollinated by bats and other nocturnal visitors. Bats may have the capacity to carry viable pollen over greater distances than birds. We suggest that the effect of pollen transfer by birds and bats on the genetic structure of widespread eucalypt species is potentially greatest in fragmented forests where these animals can traverse gaps of several kilometres between discontinuous stands. Greater understanding of pollen movement by birds and bats in natural eucalypt forest is a prerequisite to understanding the potential for gene movement from commercial eucalypt plantations into native forests. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Although forest wildfires threaten to impoverish vast expanses of once fire-resistant humid tropical forest, their effects on the vertebrate fauna remain poorly understood. We report results from a study in central Brazilian Amazonia examining a large area of terra firma (unflooded) forest that had been affected by fires during the 1997-1998 El Niño-mediated dry season. By sampling 0.25-ha forest plots both one and three years after fire disturbance, we noted that over time the bird community became increasingly dissimilar from that in unburned control plots. The influences of burn severity and recurrent fires were then examined across 28 plots that were all sampled three years after the fires. Foraging guilds differed in their responses to the gradient of increasing burn severity; most guilds declined, although arboreal granivores, frugivores, and nectarivores showed unimodal responses and arboreal gleaning insectivores increased. These responses were strongly correlated with associated changes in the habitat structure and reflected differences in resource abundance where this was quantified. Rates of species turnover were high, and there was virtually no species overlap between unburned forest plots and those that had burned in more than one El Niño dry season. Our results indicate that, unless conservation strategies can prevent a recurrent fire regime from becoming established in seasonally dry tropical forests, only nonforest and second-growth bird species, which are of minimal conservation importance, will be able to persist in fire-prone landscapes of the future.

AB  - I analyzed the species composition, structure, and trophic organization of bird assemblages in the forest canopy around Manaus, Brazil. Using three canopy towers located in primary terra firme forests, I conducted 117 censuses over a 13 month period, recording 160 bird species. The three study sites had similar species richness (between 126 and 128 species), sharing 95 species in common, which accounted for >90% of all individual records. Most species recorded in the canopy (110) belonged to the core canopy avifauna. The other 50 species included migrants (13), species that feed overhead (8), species from lower strata (15), night birds (3), and vagrants or visitors from open areas and second-growth forests (11). Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama. I suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the bird community composition in the forest canopy, allowing a higher influx of opportunistic species.

AB  - We studied the conservation status of Atlantic forest birds in 43 forest fragments ranging in size from 1 to 384 ha in the Viçosa region of southeastern Brazil. We compared data from 15 years of field work with historical records from the region, mainly originating from specimens collected by João Moojen during the 1930s. We used published studies associated with museum data and current field work to assess the decline of forest birds during the last 70 years and to relate their disappearance to forest fragmentation and destruction. At least 28 bird species have become locally extinct, 43 are critically endangered, and 25 are vulnerable, representing 60. 7% of the original forest bird community known to exist in the region. Vulnerability to fragmentation differed among guilds, forest strata, and endemicity status. Birds that feed on fruit and seeds, and those that feed on insects, were more threatened than omnivores and carnivores. Nectarivorous species were less threatened than other guilds. Moreover, terrestrial and under story birds or birds using only one forest stratum also were more likely to have been threatened. Finally, Atlantic forest endemics were more likely to have become extinct than nonendemic species. In general, sensitivity to environmental disturbance at the local level was similar to the predicted vulnerability to regional disturbance derived from the literature. Our results indicate that a serious decline of Atlantic forest birds is underway and that many other species of birds, not previously recognized as threatened, are of conservation concern.

AB  - The effect of landscape structure on bird species composition was studied in a temperate forest in Buenos Aires, central Argentina. A total of 50 sampling points were located along six transects perpendicular to the coastline. Transects were located about 2000 m apart each one and points inside transects were 200-250 m spaced. Relative abundance per species was determined in each point in November-December 2000. A 25 m fixed radius was used. A square area 200-m in side was used to estimate forest area and forest-grassland edge longitude around each point using aerial photographs scale 1:10000. Points were ordered using a Principal Components Analysis. Differences in trophic features and geographic distribution were analyzed for species showing opposite trends in the ordination diagram. The principal axis describing the compositional variation was associated to forest area surrounding sampled points. Total species richness was associated neither to the compositional axis nor to forest area. However, significant relationships were found between forest area and species richness when species were differentiated by biogeographical and trophic characteristics. A positive relation was found for species geographically restricted to subtropical forest regions as well as for those consuming insects on tree foliage and fruits. Negative relations were found for species with a wider geographical distribution including Pampa, Monte and Patagonia provinces, as well as for those consuming insects on the understory and on the ground, and seeds. Forest-grassland edge longitude was correlated to forest area, and both variables were similarly correlated to species richness of different groups. No effect of edge longitude was detected after removing the area effect. A high diversity can be found in areas with either more than 50% or less than 5% cover of forest. Such conditions maximize the probability of finding species associated to dense and open forest, respectively.

AB  - Logs have been recognized as being important components of forest ecosystems acting as a reservoir for Carbon, as sites for seedling establishment and as habitat for insects, birds and other wildlife. In this study, red beech (Nothofagus fusca) logs of a similar decay class were selected from an old-growth forest in the South Island of New Zealand, to investigate the influence of log proximity on invertebrate community composition and litter quality. Core samples were taken from the forest floor at 0 m (beneath logs), 1.5 and 2.5 m distances from the logs, and invertebrates were extracted from the litter and fermentation layer using Tullgren funnels. All invertebrates were identified to family level with the exception of Acari (mites), which were identified as recognizable taxonomic units (RTUs). The invertebrate fauna of the litter layer was more diverse than that of the fermentation layer and log proximity affected invertebrate family composition in both the litter and fermentation layers. Of the 79 invertebrate families and 41 RTUs extracted from all core samples, five families and three RTUs differed significantly among the three distances from the logs. In the litter layer Threvid larvae (Diptera) and Phlaeothripidae (Thysanura) significantly increased in abundance with increasing distance from the logs. While Dalodesmidae (Diplopoda), Neobisiidae (Arachnida), Amphinectidae (Arachnida) and mite RTUs O, AB, AM occupying the leaf litter and mite RTU AM occupying the fermentation layer significantly decreased in abundance with increasing distance from the log. The density of litter properties such as leaves, twigs, wood, roots, soil and fragments <2 mm differed significantly between the litter and fermentation layers. The density of wood in samples collected beneath logs was higher than that of samples taken at the other distances. At all distances, the C:N ratio was significantly higher in the litter layer compared with the fermentation layer. The C:N ratio beneath the logs in the fermentation layer was significantly higher than that at the other distances. The results indicate that red beech logs influence litter-dwelling invertebrate communities which has consequences for below-ground processes and has implications for CWD management in production forests. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We examined habitat use, nest location, diet, and activity patterns of radio-marked Northern Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium gnoma) during four breeding seasons (1994-97) in fragmented forests on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. We observed foraging in all available vegetation categories, but patterns of use were non-random. Structurally diverse and older forests were most heavily used, openings and patches of saplings received the least use, and use of edge was intermediate. We located eight nests, all in woodpecker cavities in patches of structurally-diverse forest. We found no clear evidence that nests were located near edges. Northern Pygmy-Owls were diurnally active, and male owls delivered food to females during nest establishment and incubation, and to both females and nestlings during brooding. Date of fledging varied from mid-June to mid-July. Fledging was synchronous, and minimum estimates of brood size ranged from 1-5. Diet included a mix of small birds, mammals and insects. Our results suggest that the creation of openings by clear-cut logging is unlikely to benefit Northern Pygmy-Owls. and that the replacement of structurally diverse forests with uniform forests may be detrimental.

AB  - We quantitatively assessed edge effects associated with elevated abundance of a hyper aggressive bird species, the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, in fragmented eucalypt forest adjoining developed land. Long-term data from Toohey Forest, subtropical Australia, show that noisy miner colonies intensively occupy a zone of 20 m from the forest edge, with frequent use occurring up to 100 m from the edge, but little beyond 200 m. Within noisy miner colonies, the abundance and species richness of other birds were both about half those recorded at nearby transects which were outside the colonies' main activity area. Bird species smaller than noisy miners, which are also those with similar diets, were collectively 20-25 times more abundant, and their species richness tenfold greater, outside miner colonies than within them. whereas larger species, which have less dietary overlap, did not differ. Exclusion of small insectivorous birds has been hypothesised to cause elevated insect herbivore density, but we found no difference between tree crown defoliation or dieback rates within versus outside miner colonies. Aggression by noisy miners can be viewed as a mechanism of interspecific competition, since miners have a relatively large body size for their diet and are hence able to exclude virtually all potential competitors at relatively little cost. We examine evidence indicating that reduced bird diversity in eucalypt forest fragments of eastern Australia is often simply the effect of noisy miner occupancy of edges, acting directly on the densities of other species through their aggressive behaviour. With an edge effect 200 m deep, a remnant 10 ha in size is likely to become entirely occupied by noisy miners, and this is a size threshold that has been commonly reported in association with area-standardised avian diversity reductions. Convergent patterns of species loss from small forest fragments in different continents are the result of different underlying ecological processes.

AB  - We analyzed seasonal variation in avian species richness and relative abundance at the community and guild level during a 13-month period in central Bolivia in an 11-ha patch of Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest, a high-Andean ecosystem that has suffered from extreme anthropogenic fragmentation. Birds were surveyed audio-visually (supplemented with mist net data) and assigned to five relative abundance categories for 2-month survey periods. We recorded 35 core species, including 16 insectivores (46%), 11 frugi-granivores (31%), seven nectarivores (20%), and one carnivore (3%). Core species richness varied from 25 (June-July) to 33 (October-November). Insectivores had a significantly higher proportion of year-round residents (81%) than frugi-granivores (45%) or nectarivores (14%); the same trend was evident with respect to seasonal variation in species richness of each guild. Although most species varied considerably in their relative abundance, no guild showed significant variation in relative abundance scores among survey periods. However, frugi-granivores and nectarivores combined, both of which depend upon plants as food resources, reached a significant minimum in mid-winter (June-July), and the same result was found at the community level. The insectivore guild thus was the most temporally stable both in terms of species richness and abundance. Qualitative observations indicated that the fluctuations in frugi-granivores and nectarivores were related to the availability of food resources.

AB  - Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to nonnative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for detecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

AB  - Eugenia uniflora L. (pitanga) is widely distributed in tropical areas. It is present in coastal vegetation from Ceara, in northeastern Brazil, to Rio Grande do Sul, at the southern tip of the country. Eugenia uniflora is of ecological importance, both as colonizing species on disturbed land and as food supplier for a wide variety of insects, birds and mammals. Pitanga plays a role in the maintenance of shrubby coastal ecosystems, especially at disturbed sites, and in 'restinga' ecosystems, at the interface between low forest and strand vegetation. To investigate the genetic diversity residing within the species, three neighboring populations at a distance of less than 24 km from each other, with varying degrees of human impact, were studied. The level of genetic diversity within and between populations was assessed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methodology. A total of 532 AFLP markers were analyzed in 66 individual trees. The polymorphism level varied from 61.2 to 96% depending on the primer combination used. Intra- and inter-population genetic diversity analysis showed that more than 88% of the variation resided within the populations, with a Gst of 0.123. Nevertheless, using neighbor joining (NJ) and principal component analysis (PCA), on the genetic distance (GD) data, permitted the three analyzed populations to be differentiated.

AB  - Determining the impact of forest disturbance and fragmentation on tropical biotas is a central goal of conservation biology. Among tropical forest birds, understory insectivores are particularly sensitive to habitat disturbance and fragmentation, despite their relatively small sizes and freedom from hunting pressure. Why these birds are especially vulnerable to fragmentation is not known. Our data indicate that the best determinant of the persistence of understory insectivorous birds in small fragments is the ability to disperse through deforested countryside habitats. This finding contradicts our initial hypothesis that the decline of insectivorous birds in forest fragments is caused by impoverished invertebrate prey base in fragments. Although we observed significantly fewer insectivorous birds in smaller fragments, extensive sampling of invertebrate communities (106,082 individuals) and avian diets (of 735 birds) revealed no important differences between large and small fragments. Neither habitat specificity nor drier fragment microclimates seemed critical. Bird species that were less affected by forest fragmentation were, in general, those that used the deforested countryside more, and we suggest that the key to their conservation will be found there.

AB  - Nestedness in biota as a function of species richness - biota of depauperate assemblages being non-random subsets of richer biotas - has been widely documented in recent years (see Wright et al. 1998, Oecologia 113: 1-20). Ordering sites by richness maximizes nestedness indices; however, ordering by other criteria such as area or isolation may be more ecologically interpretable. We surveyed birds in true fragments (35 in all), and in "reference areas" in large extant forest blocks (30 locations), of the same range of areas (10, 20, 40, 80 ha). The avifauna was divided into "bush birds" - species dependent on forest and woodland, and "open country" species. We looked at nestedness in four data sets: "bush birds" in fragments and reference areas, and "all birds" in fragments and in reference areas. All data sets were significantly nested. Ordering by area in all cases was not significantly less nested than ordering by richness. Ordering by area in fragments was significantly greater than in reference areas, but the differences in standardized nestedness indices were small (< 15%). We identified those birds that had distributions among fragments that conformed strongly with area, those that were more randomly distributed and some species that were more likely to occupy the smallest fragments. Among the latter was a hyperaggressive, invasive, colonial native species (noisy miner Manorina melanocephala). A suite of small, insectivorous birds was more likely to strongly conform with expected distributions in relation to area, which was consistent with observations of their vulnerability to the effects of the noisy miner in smaller fragments.

AB  - A review was carried out of the mammalian fauna of the Kilum-Ijim forest in the mountains of northwest Cameroon. The purpose was to examine the loss of species, particularly of larger mammals, and the implications of this for forest ecology. Information was collected by direct observation, hunter interviews and a literature review. The forest is the largest remaining representative fragment of the West African montane forest habitat. Seventy-seven species of mammal have been recorded in the forest over the last 50 years. Most are small, especially rodents, bats and insectivores. Seven species are endemic to the Kilum-Ijim area. The process of species extirpation probably began over 100 years ago with the loss of the mega-fauna, possibly beginning with elephant Loxodonta africana (several generations ago), and certainly with buffalo Syncerus caffer (at least 20 years ago), and other large mammals. Remaining large mammal population densities are very low and many species are close to regional extinction. The long-term consequences of these extinctions is uncertain but, as many tree species are monkey- or ruminant-dispersed, severe ecosystem damage has probably already occurred. Human population density in the area is around 300 people per sq km, and no sustainable offtake of wild animals will ever be possible that would provide more than a few grams of meat per person per year from the forest. The protein requirements of the communities of the area will have to continue to be supplied from domesticated stock. Since 1987 the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project of BirdLife International has been working to conserve the remaining forest, using a community forestry approach in collaboration with traditional and local authorities and the government of Cameroon. The project is investigating ways to improve the production of domestic animals outside the forest boundary.

AB  - This study investigated relationships between the composition of bird communities and remnant and landscape attributes including area, shape, vegetation type and position in the landscape. Vegetation type was the strongest determinant of bird communities. The bird community of river red gum forests was most different from that of white cypress pine woodlands, with the bird communities of other vegetation types intermediate between these two extremes. Honeyeaters and hollow-nesting birds were associated with river red gum forests, whereas small insectivores were associated with white cypress pine woodlands. Bird communities also varied significantly with remnant size. Small insectivores were more likely to be found in remnants larger than 200 ha, whereas noisy miners and grey butcherbirds were more likely to be found in remnants smaller than 100 ha. Vegetation type, remnant area, absence of noisy miners and presence of small insectivores are interrelated. It is likely that the aggressive noisy miner, rather than remnant size per se, determines the presence or absence of small insectivores in remnants. Remnant attributes appeared to be more important than landscape attributes in determining the composition of bird communities, although the widespread occurrence of noisy miners may inhibit the benefits that landscape vegetation might provide. As long as an aggressive edge specialist dominates small remnants and there is a shortage of quality, core patches that might benefit from connectivity, we consider that a focus on landscape connections is a dangerous diversion for efforts directed towards biodiversity conservation. Large, high-quality patches must be established and protected for the conservation of declining birds. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many areas of the humid tropics, relatively small patches of forest is the habitat most commonly available for forest-dwelling organisms. To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited ≥13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic edges on lea-litter and shrub arthropods were examined in both agriculture and forestry-dominated landscapes in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Microclimate, vegetation, and shrub and leaf-litter arthopods were sampled at south-facing forest edges and interiors of three sites within each landscape. Forest edges in the agricultural landscape were older and had vegetation structures that differed from those in the forestry landscape. This resulted in a sharper contrast in microclimate (temperature and humidity) between edge and interior in forests abutting agriculture than in stands abutting recent clearcuts. Arthopods from the leaf-litter and shrub-layer samples exhibited different responses to edges. In both landscapes, total shrub-arthopod abundance was not significantly affected by edges, while total leaf-litter arthropod abundance was lower at edges than in forest interiors. This reduced abundance of leaf-litter arthropods could negatively affect birds and other insectivorous vertebrates or could have been greater vertebrate predation there. Forest edges in agriculture and forestry landscapes represent relative extremes in edge maturity, demonstrating that age of edges cannot completely mitigate edge on microclimate and abundance of arthropods. We discuss the implications of our findings for influences of forest fragmentation and landscape change on forest birds.

AB  - We analysed the effects of forest fragmentation on the flock structure of insectivorous forest passerines (Parus, Aegithalos, Certhia, Regulus, etc.), and on the anti-predator behaviour and energy management of blue tits in these flocks. We surveyed flocks in Central Spain during two winters. Flocks in fragments comprised fewer individuals and species than flocks in unfragmented forests. The most abundant species in forest flocks (blue tit, Parus caeruleus, and firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus) were also the most abundant in fragments, while the rarest species in the area never occurred in small woodlots. We investigated how fragmentation and related changes in flock structure affect anti-predator behaviour of blue tits, a widely distributed species in the area. In fragments but not in forests, blue tits increased scanning rates with decreasing flock size. Vigilance was relaxed when great tits, Parus major, were abundant as flock mates, suggesting that the absence of this dominant species in fragments could intensify anti-predator behaviour of blue tits. Blue tits enhanced anti-predator behaviour in the second winter parallel to an increase in the abundance of raptors. This behavioural change was stronger in fragments, where blue tits foraged deeper in the canopy and increased scanning and hopping rates. Under increased predation risk, birds are expected to reduce body mass to improve predator avoidance. On average, blue tits weighed similar in fragments and forests the second winter. However, they accumulated fat along the day in fragments only, and adjusted body mass to body size more closely in that habitat type. This suggests that blue tits perceived fragments as unpredictable habitats where fattening would help avoid starvation, but also as dangerous sites where overweight would further increase the risk of predation. In summary, our results support that fragmentation affects individual behaviour of blue tits, and show the potential of behavioural approaches to unravel how different species face the advancing fragmentation of their habitats.

AB  - The nature of the landscape matrix can control the capacity of forest organisms to move among forest patches. Some matrices may constitute foraging or breeding habitat and, as a result, could influence the local abundance of forest organisms and their persistence in fragmented landscapes. This study represents a first approach to examining the effect of natural vs. anthropogenic landscape matrices on the abundance of neotropical birds in forest sites. The influence of three contrasting matrices on the relative abundance of 113 bird species in a subandean region was evaluated. Species were grouped into categories showing the same response to the matrix, and these groups were then examined to determine whether ecological characteristics or taxonomic affinities were associated with responses to surrounding matrices. The abundance of individual species in forest plots within a continuous forest matrix was compared with their abundance in forest fragments embedded in pastures or exotic-tree plantations. The matrix surrounding forest areas was a major factor influencing bird abundance: 65.5% of the species showed significant differences in abundance among sites surrounded by different matrices. The most important explanatory factors in the variation in abundance within fragments were: abundance within continuous forest, presence in the anthropogenic matrices, migratory strategy, and habitat association. Species with small geographic ranges and species of terrestrial insectivores had low tolerance to fragmentation. Responses were highly species specific and largely independent of foraging strata, trophic group, and taxonomic affinities. Several lines of evidence indicate an increased connectivity among forest remnants surrounded by exotic-tree plantations compared to pastures. Landscape supplementation by the exotic-tree plantation matrix was observed for a hummingbird species. These results suggest that structurally complex anthropogenic matrices have potential as management tools for bird conservation by complementing habitat protection and restoration.

AB  - Relationships between food habits, home range and activity of the black-eared opossum, Didelphis aurita (Marsupialia, Didelphidae), were studied in an urban forest fragment (5 ha) of southern Brazil from February 1995 to January 1996. Captures were performed weekly using 30 live-traps placed uniformly in the study area. Diet was determined through faecal analysis, home ranges were calculated through the Minimum Convex Polygon method and the activity period was assessed from the time of captures in the night. The opossum proved to be an insectivorous-omnivorous marsupial consuming invertebrates (100%), fruits (78%) and vertebrates (59%). Birds, mammals, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Opiliones and Solanaceous fruits were the main items consumed. Opossums foraged during the first hours of the night in part synchronizing their activity with that of small mammals occasionally preyed upon. Home ranges measured from 0.2 ha for a female to 3.0 ha for a male. Males appeared in the study area only during the wet season, increasing their home range size, whereas females revealed quite exclusive home ranges that could imply the defence of a territory.

AB  - 1. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to the difference between the right and left sides in characters that should otherwise be bilaterally symmetrical, but whose expression is affected by epigenetic stress during development. Forest fragmentation may promote an increase in FA in isolated populations, by either genetic or environmental stress. FA may function as a biomonitor index in conservation biology if increased levels were observed in populations from fragmented habitats. 2. We tested the hypothesis that FA is higher in birds from small tropical forest patches than in large forest tracts. We measured wing and tarsus FA on mist-netted birds from seven fragments and seven continuous areas from south-eastern Atlantic rain forest in Brazil. We performed FA comparisons between fragments and control groups for the whole community, for individual foraging guilds and for the six most abundant species. 3. Wing and tarsus FA were significantly greater in fragments than continuous areas for the whole community and were both negatively correlated with forest fragment size. Differences in FA varied among foraging guilds, being more evident for insectivorous species, especially those feeding in or near the understorey. 4. FA levels increased significantly in forest fragments in at least one trait for five of the six most abundant species. There was no correlation between tarsus and wing asymmetries for the individuals of any species nor any difference between the degree of asymmetries of these characters. 5. We suggest that FA is a useful tool to assess the effects of fragmentation on forest birds, and may be applied in monitoring neotropical birds. FA indices might be profitably developed, particularly in species most threatened by fragmentation effects and when investigated in different morphological characters.

AB  - The study was carried out in an area located at Serra do Mar, belonging to Mata Atlântica formation, also known as Atlantic Rain Forest, near the town of Paraibuna, State of São Paulo, Brazil (located at latitude 23 ° 31'S to 23 ° 33'S, longitude 45 ° 39'W to 45 ° 42'W and altitude of 944 to 1.136 m). Three fragments of natural vegetation (sizes of 46.92 ha, 4.28 ha and 26.38 ha) and an adjacent area of eucalypts plantation (42.15 ha), were utilized for the surveys. In all situations the understorey was quite prominent and the vegetation of the gallery forest fragments were in a medium stage of secondary regeneration. The fragment of smaller size was formed by a corridor of natural vegetation, connecting the two larger fragments. The objectives of the study were to analyze the groups of birds that were affected by the forest fragmentation and, additionally, to evaluate the impacts caused by the fragmentation and the isolation degree of these areas, using birds as ecological indicator to analyze the corridor's effectiveness to the passage of genetic material among fragments. The method used to register the avifauna specimens was the captures and recaptures supported by mist nets installed within the fragments understorey and within an eucalypts plantation. Taking into account 2.502 hours of mist net in all studied areas, it was possible to register a total of 54 species of birds, distributed over a range of 14 families and 6 orders. The main species were characterized as insect-eating and omnivorous. The species composition was affected by the fragmentation and also by the reduction of the natural vegetation. The quantity and diversity of birds showed a direct relationship with the size of the fragment and structure of the vegetation and an inverse relationship with the isolation degree of the area. There was no evidence of passage of any typical forest avifauna individuals by the corridor. The registration of great quantity of common species to both fragments and corridor, of several trophic groups and distribution in the different strata of the vegetation, demonstrates the dynamics among these environments. The corridor is working as an effective habitat area, complementing the network of existent reserve. The width is directly attached to the corridor effectiveness, however, the ideal width is an empiric measure, because several variables can affect the species flux to the corridor, as area, isolation degree, structure and vegetation composition, edge effect, neighborhood type and anthropic pressures. The eucalypts plantations, even containing the understorey level quite prominent, form an effective barrier to different avifauna species, mainly over those ones that live in the core zone of the forest.

AB  - We investigated the factors structuring lake shore bird assemblages of the northeastern U.S.A. using data collected from 158 lakes between 1992 and 1994. The assemblage data were aggregated and standardized to produce assemblage compositions consisting of proportions of individuals employing different foraging, dietary, and migratory strategies. The assemblage data were then re-expressed using compositional analysis techniques and subjected to regression tree analysis to identify environmental correlates over a range of scales. Regionally, human density in the watershed was the most important predictor for the foraging, dietary, and migratory compositions. A combination of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors likely contributed to these broadscale associations because land use was largely confounded with climate and geomorphology. More locally, associations with lake shore residential-urban development were identified as being important for the foraging and dietary compositions, as were associations with lake shore wetlands, but only contingent there being little human development present locally and regionally. Assemblages were associated with increasing local and regional human development such that: hawking, aerial foraging, and ground gleaning individuals increased relative to hover-and-gleaners, foliage gleaners, and bark gleaners; omnivores increased relative to insectivores; and residents increased relative to neotropical migrants. The observed changes in bird community structure were consistent with declines in forest interior species relative to edge species in response to forest fragmentation and suggest that anthropogenic factors have played a prominent role in structuring lake shore bird assemblages of this region.

Lake-shore bird and habitat data were collected from 158 lakes in New England, New York, and New Jersey, and each specie was classified according to its foraging technique, its dietary preference, and it migratory status. The data were aggregated and standardized to produce assemblage compositions consisting of relative proportions of individuals employing different life history strategies. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed using explanatory variables that constituted a spatially nested hierarchy that characterized the landscape, watershed, lake shore, and lake basin. Results showed that anthropogenic variables accounted for the most variance in all three CART models. Human settlement was associated closely with assemblage structure at broad spatial scales. Analysis of the data revealed that hawking, aerial foraging, and ground-gleaning individuals had increased relative to hover-and-gleaners, forage gleaners, and bark gleaners. Also, omnivores had increased relative to insectivores, and residents had increased relative to migrants.

AB  - Understanding how the fauna of logged tropical rainforests responds to fragmentation and the creation of edges is vital to ensure conservation of biodiversity. We studied the composition of the understory bird community from the edge of a 15-ha clearing toward the interior of the forest in apart of Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, that was selectively logged about 45 years ago. Mist netting was conducted along five transects from the edge and 500 m into the interior. The total number of individuals captured did not change with distance from the edge, but there was a significant increase in the number of species. We sampled fewer, but more common species near the edge, whereas the interior of the forest had more, and less common species. Guild composition also changed with distance from the edge. Frugivore-insectivores and nectarivores were most common close to the edge. Among insectivores, ground foragers, bark-gleaners, and leaf-gleaners were most common in the interior of the forest, whereas sallying insectivores favored the edge. Graminivores were unaffected by the edge. Analysis of common species showed that Ispidina picta, Andropadus curvirostris, A. latirostris, Camaroptera brachyura, Terpsiphone rufiventer, and Nectarinia olivacea were associated with the edge, but no species showed significant avoidance of the edge. This finding may be explained by the generally low sample sizes of interior species. Our results show that even bird communities in logged forests respond to edges. Estimates of edge effects suggested that changes in bird densities may have occurred several hundred meters from the edge. In conclusion, logged forests provide habitat for bird species avoiding forest edges, and this should be considered in the management of such forests for conservation.

AB  - We studied avian attendance at swarms of Eciton burchelli and Labidus praedator (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ecitoninae) over 5-mo periods in both 1996 and 1997, at elevations between 1400 m and 1800 m in western Panama. We conducted area searches for swarms of raiding ants and attendant birds in intact forest, traditional shade coffee habitats both adjacent to and distant from forest, and in sun coffee habitats, quantifying the size and composition of attendant flocks. All habitats except sun coffee supported numerous army ant swarms and thus a diverse assemblage of ant-following birds. A total of 411 swarming occasions attracted 126 bird species of 28 families. Of the 103 resident species, two were obligate ant-following birds, the Ruddy Woodcreeper (Dendrocincla homochroa) and the Gray-headed Tanager (Eucometris penicillata). Of the remaining species, 18 were wintering Nearctic migrants, and five were transient Nearctic migrants. Nearctic migrant species composed a greater percentage of the attendant species in shade coffee habitats as compared to forest. Several species of forest resident birds that correspond with particular foraging guilds, such as understory bark insectivores, including D. homochroa, regularly occurred in adjacent shade coffee but were never observed at swarms in distant shade coffee. Army ants may therefore be a mechanism for bringing forest birds into shade coffee, but only to a point. In western Panama, mid-elevational traditional shade coffee plantations can provide additional habitat for the diverse avifauna that attend army ant swarms. With increasing distance from large areas of continuous forest, however, the value of traditional shade coffee habitats is lessened for certain components of the bird community. Thus, protection of these habitats adjacent to intact forest should receive priority. Additionally, current transformation of coffee-growing practices, including the removal of shade trees to grow coffee in full sun, will negatively affect army ants and their associated avian followers.

AB  - Many forest-interior songbirds are considered 'area sensitive' because they are absent from smaller forest remnants in fragmented landscapes. Reductions in food abundance with fragment size could explain area sensitivity, but to date, only one empirical study has investigated this possibility. From 1995 to 1997, we tested the food abundance hypothesis in two small (~55-ha) and two large (> 400-ha) forest fragments located in a matrix of agricultural land in northeastern New South Wales, Australia. We measured differences in food abundance by comparing the biomass of surface-dwelling invertebrates in large and small fragments. We also determined whether food supply was associated with foraging efficiency and reproductive performance in an area-sensitive, ground-foraging insectivore, the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis), breeding at these same sites. Invertebrate biomass in the small fragments was about half of that in the large fragments. Incubating female robins received 40% less food from males, females left their nests more frequently to forage on their own, and nestlings were provisioned with less food in the small fragments. Females in the small fragments also had a shorter breeding season (by three weeks), laid eggs that were 7% lighter, and reared smaller nestlings. Because our measures of invertebrate biomass, foraging efficiency, and reproduction produced corresponding results, we conclude that Eastern Yellow Robins experienced relative food shortage in these small fragments. Therefore, food shortage probably influences area sensitivity in this species. We suggest that the role of food supply be given greater consideration in other fragmentation studies.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to assess the effects of forest fragmentation on winter flock formation in a guild of insectivorous birds in 23 parks (0.23-118 ha) in the Madrid area, Spain. Flock size was positively affected by fragment size, the amount of coniferous cover, and the mean number of trees > 50 cm diameter at breast height; and negatively by the distance to the nearest large forest track (1722 ha). Flock richness was not affected by any landscape and habitat factor. Coefficients of associations in multi-species flocks were higher for the most abundant species. That the probabilities of flock formation decreased in small fragments is probably a result of the reduction of habitat quantity and quality. Flock formation appears greatly affected by the abundance of individual species (Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Coal Tit Parus ater), as they attract less abundant species and form the core of the winterflocks.

AB  - We examined the distributions of nine species of terrestrial insectivorous birds in 4- to 14-year-old rainforest fragments north of Manaus, Brazil we surveyed 11 fragments of 1, 10, and 100 ha, 95 ha of secondary vegetation, and nine continuous forest plots (controls) of 1-100 ha. We augmented standard spot-mapping with extensive playback surveys. The fragments had been sampled with mist nets before isolation, so our results could be compared with the pre-isolation distribution. For the nine species, there were 55 cases of local extinction in the 11 fragments between about 1 year after isolation and the time of our surveys. This corresponds to 74% extinction of the local populations in fragments. These extinctions occurred despite the second-growth connection of some fragments to continuous forest us little as 70 m away. Three apparent colonization events by species not detected before isolation also occurred, but these may also reflect inadequate sampling before isolation. Our comparison of fragments and similar-sized control plots in continuous forest showed an area effect on species richness in both fragments and control plots, but fragments had fewer species than control plots of equal size. In a fragmented Amazonian landscape, the full suite of terrestrial insectivores would persist in the short term only in large fragments (>100 ha), although much larger areas are probably necessary for the long-term persistence of their populations.

AB  - Current understanding of the effects of forest fragmentation is based largely on studies in temperate regions, Australia, and Neotropical lowlands. In contrast, the consequences of anthropogenic forest fragmentation for Andean avifaunas are poorly understood, despite large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation. I assessed the effects of long-term fragmentation on a subandean avifauna in Colombia by comparing the occurrence of bird species in forest fragments isolated over 50-90 years with the original avifauna. Prefragmentation bird composition was based on historical records and current species composition in continuous forest. The original avifauna had approximately 139 forest species and 45 species of open habitats. Among forest species, 30% were currently extinct in fragmented forest and 4% were regionally extinct. At least 23 nonforest species colonized the region from the lowlands following deforestation. Species with small geographic ranges and those that were locally scarce or rare throughout their ranges were likely to be locally extinct. Forest raptors, terrestrial insectivores, and large frugivores were highly extinction prone, whereas nectarivores, small frugivores, and aerial insectivores were highly resilient; other guilds were intermediate. Antbirds (Formicariidae, Thamnophilidae), Cotingas, and, especially, Icterids were highly extinction prone. Large body size was not a determinant of vulnerability except among frugivores. Sixty-two percent of the species of special conservation concern were extinct in fragments. These results suggest that only large forest tracts will ensure the survival of a large proportion of subandean avifaunas. Fragments of mature forest, however, may support a diverse avifauna, including small populations of globally endangered species several decades after isolation. These fragments could play an important role in the restoration of local avifaunas. A good understanding of the mechanisms that allow persistence in such fragments may prove essential for the conservation of those species for which no large tracts of suitable habitat remain.

AB  - Aspen (Populus spp.) woodland is increasing within native grasslands in north-central North Dakota, and this increase concerns land managers. We examined avian associations in aspen groves of various sizes on and near J. Clark Salyer National Wildlife Refuge in 1995-96 to predict how bird communities change as woody plant cover increases within a grassland-dominated landscape. Avian species richness increased as aspen grove size increased, particularly for bird species classified as forest interior, neotropical migrant, ground nesting, or insectivorous. Large (i.e., >100-ha) aspen groves provided suitable habitat for 12 area-sensitive species while also meeting the requirements of more ubiquitous habitat generalists. Conversely, small aspen groves did not support the number or diversity of avian species and were occupied by edge-associated species. None of 53 species recorded in the study were restricted to small aspen groves. We conclude that limiting the spread of aspen woodland into native grassland and eliminating small (i.e., <5-ha) aspen groves where feasible will not adversely impact woodland breeding bird communities. Many avian species occur with greater frequency in aspen woodlands than in eastern deciduous forest. Large woodlands contribute to local avian diversity and may provide habitat for forest species that have shown regional or continental population declines.

AB  - I evaluated the effects of selective logging upon a bird community in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Two areas 500 m apart were selected for quantitative (point censuses) avian surveys: a non-fragmented primary forest (PF) and a selectively logged forest (LF). Six of eight quantitative measures of vegetation structure compared between PF and LF were reduced at LF. Indices of avian species richness and diversity were very similar between PF and LF sites; species composition, however, differed strongly. Although the composition of guilds remained largely the same, most guilds differed in membership between PF and LF in at least one species. Understory and terrestrial insectivores were the most sensitive ecological groups (with most species missing in LF), as also observed in the process of forest fragmentation in other parts of the Neotropics. Based on the results of this study, I recommend the following procedures to minimize adverse effects of selective logging on bird communities in the Atlantic forest: (1) logged areas should be close enough to unfragmented, unlogged forests to allow recolonization of some species, (2) the exploitation of the forest should be carded out using as few roads and as little mechanized equipment as possible, and (3) long-term rotation should be used in areas designed for logging to allow time for forest regeneration.

AB  - The author discusses the decline of migratory songbirds that breed in the north temperate zone and spend the winter in the tropics. The declines may result from destruction of their winter habitat or, alternatively, from degradation via fragmentation of forest used for nesting in the north. The author suggests that extensive, continuous forests should be preserved not only because they contain a diverse assemblage of forest migrants, but also because they are the source of immigrants that sustain populations of forest migrants in other regions where forest cover has been disrupted. Insectivorous birds (most of which are migrants) can prevent outbreaks of leaf-eating insects in forests, so a major decline in migrants could affect the health and stability of forests. More generally, conservation efforts must be planned at the scale of regional landscape.

AB  - We review characteristics of birds in boreal forests in the context of their ecological sustainability under both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. We identify the underlying ecological factors associated with boreal bird populations and their variability, review the interactions between boreal bird populations and disturbance, and describe some tools on how boreal bird populations may be conserved in the future. The boreal system has historically been an area with extensive disturbance such as fire, insect outbreaks, and wind. In addition, the boreal system is vulnerable to global climate change as well as increasing pressure on forest and water resources. Current knowledge indicates that birds play an important role in boreal forests, and sustaining these populations affords many benefits to the health of boreal forests. Many issues must be approached with caution, including the lack of knowledge on our ability to mimic natural disturbance regimes with management, our lack of understanding on fragmentation due to logging activity, which is different from permanent conversion to other land uses such as agriculture or residential area, and our lack of knowledge on what controls variability in boreal bird populations or the linkage between bird population fluctuations and productivity. The essential role that birds can provide is to clarify important ecological concerns and variables that not only will help to sustain bird populations, but also will contribute to the long-term health of the boreal forest for all species, including humans.

AB  - The bulk of Kenyan forests are in the afromontane biogeographical region, but the Lake Victoria basin and its biota have been referred to by many biogeographers as an eastern fragment of the Guineo-congolian forest. The Ramogi Hill forest in the lake basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 400 mm. Although much of its biota is typical of the Guineo-congolian region, several species of insects, birds, mammals and plants have been known to occur in the lowland forests of the Kenyan coast. The presence of taxa in these forests has been attributed to past geological changes and climatic fluctuations during the pleistocene period. Migration and dispersal of taxa have been through Kenya Rift or via the southern route of Rukwa Rift. The biodiversity studies conducted indicate that Ramogi Hill has low animal diversity compared to other forests. However, the importance of Ramogi Hill may be linked to its biological resources, and cultural and religious values accrued by the surrounding local communities. The preservation of Ramogi Hill as a reference point for biodiversity and sacred sites will depend a lot on the influence and participation of communities in biodiversity conservation and management programmes.

AB  - In a Neotropical montane forest in southwestern Colombia, we investigated how the distribution of understory birds changed from forest edge to forest interior (0-10 m, 30-40 m, 60-70 m, and 190-200 m from the edge) and how these changes were influenced by edge age (three old [>40 yr] and three young [<12 yr] edges) and month sampled. Capture rates of frugivores were highest both at the forest edge (0-10 m) and forest interior (190-200 m); for insectivores, capture rates were highest at the forest interior; for nectarivores, they were highest at the forest edge. Distance, edge age, and month interacted in various ways. Frugivores were more abundant at the forest interior than at the edge during the dry months. Insectivores were more abundant at new edges than at old edges during the wet months. Seventeen out of 25 abundant species (≤21 captures), including the Tangara spp. assemblage, exhibited a non-uniform distribution, showing either an increase or decrease from forest edge to forest interior, or bimodal distributions. Extremely sparse species (one capture) were found more often than expected near the forest edge (0-10 m). Edges resulting from large-scale, anthropogenic disturbances influenced the distribution of understory birds in complex ways. Significant interactions between distance, month, and edge age suggest that 'edge effects' change over various temporal scales. Instead of emphasizing 'depth' of 'edge effects,' future studies should emphasize edge dynamics, i.e., how processes taking place at edges change over time, and how organisms can modify any 'edge effect.' In particular, changes in the distribution of frugivores suggest that seed dispersal may be influenced by the presence of edges, leading to changes in the structure and location of edges through time. This might be particularly true in our study area, where transient corn fields, pastures, and second-growth areas of various ages are embedded in a forest matrix.

AB  - We studied the winter foraging behaviour of Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla and Nuthatch Sitta europaea in 18 deciduous forest fragments varying in size between 1 and 30 ha and in one forest of about 200 ha in order to examine how forest area and the presence/absence of the dominant Nuthatch affect the foraging behaviour of the subordinate Treecreeper. The Treecreeper occurred in 14 out of 18 forest fragments while the Nuthatch was only observed in seven, mainly in fragments exceeding 4 ha. We found no effect of forest size on any of the components of the foraging niches of either Treecreeper or Nuthatch, and Treecreeper foraging niches did not become broader in the smaller fragments in which Nuthatches were absent. The significant niche change we did observe was opposite to the expected direction. We conclude that winter foraging niches of small insectivorous birds do not necessarily expand in the absence of close competitors in island-like situations.

AB  - The seed dispersal system of a neotropical tree, Cabralea canjerana (Meliaceae), was studied in two forested areas in southeastern Brazil. The first study site, Parque Estadual Intervales (PEI), is a 49,000-ha reserve composed mostly of old-growth Atlantic rain forest. The second site, Mata de Santa Genebra (MSG), is a 250-ha fragment of old-secondary semideciduous forest whose present bird fauna differs markedly from the original, in part as a consequence of forest fragmentation. At PEI 35 bird species ate the diaspores of C. canjerana. Black-tailed tityra (Tityra cayana, Tyrannidae) was the main seed disperser, but several other species were also important seed dispersers. In contrast, at MSG C. canjerana diaspores were eaten by 14 bird species. At this area, the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus, Vireonidae) was the most important seed disperser, but it was also a 'waster' which dropped seeds beneath parent plants, or carried them to sites unsuitable for germination. At PEI, exposed seeds on the forest floor were heavily preyed upon by rodents and insects. Insects destroyed mainly seeds deposited near to parent plants. Insect predation was less intense at MSG than at PEI. The rodent density at MSG was unusually small, and part of the post-dispersal seed predation may be done by terrestrial birds, such as doves and tinamous, which are especially common at MSG. Some of the differences recorded between the seed dispersal systems of C. canjerana at PEI and MSG may have been the result of the fragmentation and isolation of the latter area.

AB  - Patterns of species loss and decline in a forest bird community following deforestation near Lagoa Santa, Brazil, were examined in three forest fragments during 1987. Records of 107 species were compared with those collected by Lurid and Reinhardt [Reinhardt, J. (1870). Vidensk. medd. Dansk Nat.-hist. Foren., 22, 1-124, 315-457]. Thirteen forest species recorded in the last century were not found in the same area in 1987. Some of these species were previously common. Species loss was related to fragment size; thus, in fragments of 24, 63 and 198 ha, we found 20, 29 and 34 forest species, respectively. The more diverse community of the original forest has been replaced by a community strongly dominated by a few species, at least four of which apparently were uncommon in the last century. Species that had increased in the area were small forest birds that feed on small insects in the understorey. Those that declined included species with specialized food requirements or feeding behaviour and species at the limit of their distributional range.

AB  - The distribution of insectivorous passerines was studied in 31 fragments (0.1 to 350 ha) of a holm oak (Quercus ilex) Mediterranean forest archipelago in central Spain for two consecutive springs and winters (1988 to 1990). The study aimed to assess the role of' forest size, abundance and other biological traits (nesting site and foraging substrata) of the species in their ability to occupy the fragments. The number of fragments occupied by tile species (f1) was correlated to their abundance (d1) in spring and winter. Spring-to-winter changes of d1 correlated positively to changes of f1 due to the incidence of summer migrants but failed to show any significant pattern when restricted to species occurring in both seasons. The between-winter variations of d1 correlated positively with changes in f1 while the between-spring changes of both parameters did not correlate, probably because of stronger effects of site fidelity on bird distribution in this period. Between-year persistence in the occupation of fragments was directly related to bird species abundance and, for a given abundance, persistence decreased in the smallest fragments. Hole-nesting species during the 1988 spring and the exploiters of scarce trees or foraging substrata during both winters showed an apparent restriction to colonize the smaller fragments due in part to changes in habitat structure related to fragmentation. These results support the hypothesis that abundance is a good predictor of the ability of species to occupy and persist in fragments. However, abundance alone does not fully explain the processes that determine these occupancy patterns, since other traits related to the spatial scale of' analysis and the suitability of fragments for each bird species are also involved.

AB  - Abstract: We sampled understory bummingbirds in Amazonian forest fragments from before isolation through nine years after isolation. We recorded 377 captures of eight species in five 1‐ba fragments and four 10‐ha fragments. The three species netted before isolation, Phaethornis superciliosus, Phaethornis bourcieri, and Thalurania furcata, were nearly equally abundant at that time. After isolation abundance of P. bourcieri and T. furcata did not change, but P. superciliosus became nearly twice as common. Five additional species that were netted only after isolation represented about 10% of the post‐isolation sample. The species recorded only after isolation were forest species usually found above the levels of nets; fragments were not colonized by nonforest species. Use of fragments did not differ between 1‐and 10‐ba fragments. The landscape surrounding the fragments included active cattle pasture, abandoned pasture, and Cecropia‐dominated second growth, but this variation bad little effect on use of fragments by hummingbirds. The results suggest that these understory hummingbirds can persist in a matrix of fragments, secondary growth, and large forest patches. This response is much different than that of the insectivorous birds that dominate the understory bird community at the site, which are much more vulnerable to fragmentation.

AB  - Embedded in the extensive Eucalyptus open forests and savanna woodlands that dominate the northern Australian landscape are patches of monsoon rain forest and Acacia thickets and woodlands. In this paper, the vertebrate species composition of patches of lancewood (Acacia shirleyi) thickets and woodlands of the Northern Territory was compared with that of other environments of this region: pindan woodlands (A. eriopoda and A. tumida), gidgee woodlands (A. georginae), patches of monsoon rain forests and the extensive Eucalyptus open forests and woodlands. The vertebrate fauna of lancewood thickets is distinct for that of Eucalyptus open forests, and has fewer species. Differences in species composition and richness are associated with substantial differences in resource availability, with lancewood thickets having far less grass cover (and hence relatively few granivorous birds and rodents, but more ground-feeding insectivorous and omnivorous birds), fewer nectar-bearing flowers (and hence fewer nectarivorous birds) and lower structural and floristic diversity than Eucalyptus forests. There was little difference in species richness or total abundance between the three types of Acacia woodlands sampled. Lancewood thickets had fewer species than monsoon rain forests to coastal dry monsoon rain forests to inland dry monsoon rain forests to lancewood thickets to pindan woodlands to gidgee woodlands, in accord with the pronounced rainfall gradient of this region and with canopy cover and height. Within this broad continuum the three Acacia woodlands were most closely grouped. Species turnover along this gradient consisted of substantial decrease or loss of some foraging groups (e.g. frugivorous birds) or replacement of species within broad foraging groups. The faunal relationship of the monsoon rain forests and Acacia communities provides some support for considering these fire-sensitive environments as fragments of a formerly extensive continuum. Three species (Pomatostomus temporalis, Struthidea cinerea and Melanodryas cucullata), all ground-foraging insectivorous or omnivorous birds, were significantly associated with lancewood in this region, but all three have extensive ranges beyond this area. © 1995, CSIRO.

AB  - In a mountainous area in the Dinaric Beech-Fir Forest of southern Slovenia, summer nests of the European fat dormouse (Glis glis) were collected. From these dormouse nests, 180 Monopsyllus sciurorum sciurorum fleas were examined by polymerase chain reaction with primers for the Rickettsia citrate synthase gene. Samples from one nest yielded the expected 381 base pair DNA product. The origin of the DNA product was identified as Rickettsia typhi by AluI restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Inoculation of the triturated positive fleas into Vero cell culture resulted in the cultivation of a rickettsia which reacted with polyclonal and species-specific monoclonal antibodies for R. typhi. The widespread distribution of this sylvatic flea species in nearly all of Europe as well as in the Middle East and its presence on other mammalian and avian hosts suggests that R. typhi might exist in unrecognised enzootic cycles. Further investigations are needed to determine the extent of these cycles in Europe and the potential occurrence of human infections. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Qualitative research on breeding birds was carried out in 224 woods located in an agricultural area of E Poland and with areas of between 0.01-450 ha. A total of 84 species of birds nested in them. The breeding avifauna included: a group of specie tolerant of small woods with areas of several hectares or less and a group of species which only occurred in medium-sized woods. Mean values for minimum forest area were calculated, along with values for the threshold of regular presence in the bird community. Different groups of species are vulnerable to forest fragmentation to varying degrees. Most vulnerable were true residents, hole-nesters, herbivorous birds, birds feeding on vertebrates and insectivorous birds which form mixed feeding flocks in the forests of this region in winter. Species least sensitive to forest fragmentation were omnivorous birds, the remaining insectivorous birds, ground-nesters, birds nesting in the crowns of trees and bushes, and non-residents. Significant differences in vulnerability to forest fragmentation were not noted for species foraging both in tree stands and beyond the forest. -from Author

AB  - En este artículo presentamos los resultados de una evaluación de los efectos de la fragmentación sobre la riqueza de la avifauna en un bosque andino. San Antonio es un cerro en la Cordillera Occidental de Colombia, que forma parte de un sistema de parches de bosque relictuales, con un área total de unas 700 ha, a elevaciones entre 1800 y 2100 m. La avifauna de San Antonio fue inventariada en 1911, 1959 y 1985. Durante 1990 realizamos un nuevo inventario, para compararlo con los anteriores. A principios de siglo la avifauna del bosque consistía de 128 especies. Para 1959 habían desaparecido 24 especies, y desde entonces al presente desaparecieron 16 más, para un total de 40 especies extinguidas localmente, es decir, el 31% de la avifauna del bosque original Analizamos patrones de extinción en relación con distribución geográfica y gremios tróflcos. Encontramos que para esta comunidad de montaña, las aves más vulnerables fueron las que se encontraban en su límite altitudinal de distribución; el 37% de las especies extinguidas se encontraban en su límite altitudinal superior. En cuanto a gremios tróficos, los más vulnerables fueron los insectívoros de sotobosque y los frugívoros grandes del dosel. Nuestros resultados indican que la fragmentación de bosques en un gradiente altitudinal puede ocasionar extinciones masivas, pues aísla poblaciones pequeñas de especies en sus límites altitudinales, y porque interrumpe las rutas de migración altitudinal. Destacamos la limitación que supone para este tipo de estudio la carencia de información sobre la composición de la avifauna (y de la hiota en general) de selvas andinas inalteradas. Es obvia la necesidad de aprovechar de manera inmediata toda oportunidad de crear y fortalecer bases de datos sobre estos aspectos, así como la iniciación de proyectos de monitoreo a largo piazo.

AB  - Winter bird communities were compared in three suburbs over 5 years: MT, a 70-year-old area of large houses and planted mature trees, primarily oaks (Quercus) and elms (Ulmus): YT, a 15-year-old area also built upon former open agricultural land with young planted trees, primarily maples (Acer): OP, a 15-year-old area in which houses were built within a second-growth oak-pine (Quercus-Pinus) woodland. Winter bird surveys were conducted each year for 5 years (1976-1980) during January. The total number of species across suburban types was 32: total abundance was higher (P<0.05) in MT and YT than in OP. Species richness was similar in each suburban type. Seedeaters and omnivorous ground-foragers dominated the avifaunas of MT and YT, comprising 86% and 92% of their respective avifaunal abundances. Insectivores comprised 14% of the avifauna in OP, but less than 4% and 1% respectively, in MT and YT. All significant correlations (r) between ground foragers and measures of tree cover were negative: positive relationships existed between lawn area and distance to the nearest forest fragment. All significant correlations between numbers of insectivores and measures of tree cover were positive. Even though MT contained the largest trees and the greatest tree species and shrub richness, habitat conditions for insectivorous birds were poor in this mature, planted habitat compared with those in OP, built in remnant natural woodland. © 1991.

AB  - To help fill the gap in detailed knowledge of avian community structure in tropical forests, we undertook a census of a 97-ha plot of floodplain forest in Amazonian Peru. The plot was censused over a 3-mo period spanning the 1982 breeding season. The cooperative venture entailed ≈12 person-months of effort. Conventional spot-mapping was the principal method used, but several additional methods were required to estimate the numbers of non-territorial and group-living species: direct counts of the members of mixed flocks, saturation mist-netting of the entire plot, opportunistic visual registrations at fruiting trees, determination of the average size of parrot flocks, color banding of colonial icterids, etc. Two hundred forty-five resident species were found to hold territories on the plot, or to occupy all or part of it. Seventy-four additional species were detected as occasional-to-frequent visitors, wanderers from other habitats, or as migrants from both hemispheres. By superimposing territory maps or the areas of occupancy of individual species, we determined that point (alpha) diversities exceeded 160 species in portions of the plot. About 1910 individual birds nested in 100 ha of this floodplain forest, making up a biomass conservatively estimated at 190 kg/km2. The total number of breeding birds was equivalent to that in many temperate forests, but the biomass was about five times as great. Predominantly terrestrial granivores contributed the largest component of the biomass (39%), followed by largely arboreal frugivores (22%). Considering only insectivores, the biomass (34 kg/km2) is somewhat less than that in the forest at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire (40 kg/km2), although it is greater (55 kg/km2) if one includes omnivores. The number of insectivores was considerably less than at Hubbard Brook, due to their 60% larger average body size (32 vs. 20 g). Even though a large majority of the species were patchily distributed, the 97-ha plot was found to include 99% of the bird species that regularly occupy mature floodplain forest at Cocha Cashu. The most abundant species occupied territories of 4-5 ha, and 84 species (26%) had population densities of ≤1 pair per square kilometre. Of these, 33 (10% of the total community) were judged to be constitutively rare (i.e., having low population densities everywhere), rather than being merely locally rare. Many of these are predicted to be vulnerable to forest fragmentation and disturbance. Comparison of these results with those from other tropical forests proved difficult due to a lack of standardized methodology.

AB  - In the Latrobe Valley, SE Victoria positive relationships were found for forest and total bird species and abundance with patch area or its logarithm; several other variables also made contributions, eg grazing intensity. Habitat indices were closely correlated and explained almost as much variation. Forest bird abundance did not increase with area above 10-30 ha. Numbers of forest species continued to increase with patch area but medium-sized patches (10-150 ha) supported a higher proportion of species than expected. The species present depended on habitats represented. Large reserves may be needed by some species but other forest species occurred only on medium-sized patches. More complex relationships were found for farmland and water birds. Small heavily grazed patches (<10 ha) supported few forest birds and more farmland birds, including noisy miners Manorina melanocephala which aggressively excluded other species. Few birds fed on insects in the canopy in these patches, which showed signs of dieback due to insect damage.-from Author

AB  - The foods of feral house cats in forest in the Orongorongo Valley, Wellington, were studied over 3 years and related to the availability of prey. Some cats were trapped, tagged, and released, and could be identified individually by coat colour and pattern. The number of cats, estimated from live-trapping and sightings, was stable during the study. Examination of 677 scats revealed that mammals (rat, rabbit, opossum, mouse, and stoat, in descending order of importance) formed the bulk of the diet by weight. Remains of birds occurred in 12% of scats, but birds were estimated to form only 4.5% by weight of the diet. Insect fragments were present in many scats; wetas (Orthoptera), cicadas (Hemiptera), and beetles (Coleoptera) were important seasonally. Although eaten in large numbers, they contributed very little by weight to the diet. Populations of rats, rabbits, and opossums were fairly stable during the study; mice were abundant for most of the first 18 months, but were scarce in the last year. The literature on the food habits of feral house cats is reviewed; it emphasises that cats are primarily predators of small mammals (rodents and lagomorphs). Predation by feral cats can be important in holding rat and rabbit populations at low densities and in reducing seasonal fluctuations in their numbers. Cats can also exert heavy predation pressure on low-density mouse populations. Although the cats now eat few birds, they may have been responsible for reducing the numbers of some forest birds in the past. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Ptilonorhynchidae (bower‐birds) and Ailuroedidae (cat‐birds) are families widespread throughout Australia and New Guinea and endemic to these regions. Only bower‐birds make bowers. The bower is on the ground and has no direct connexion with the nest, which is built in a tree that may be some hundreds of yards away. At each bower is a display‐ground which the owner strews with coloured flowers, fruit and shells, or, in some species, pallid or reflecting articles. These, contrary to general belief, are selected with great discrimination. Members of three genera paint their bowers with fruit‐pulp, or with charcoal or comminuted dry grass mixed with saliva. Cat‐birds, on the other hand, do not erect a special structure. Pioneer nineteenth‐century naturalists, who knew little about bower‐birds, ascribed a courtship function to the above activities and postulated an aesthetic sense as well. During the last three decades, however, there has arisen a school of Australian naturalists, which, though admitting that the displays of bower‐birds may have had their origins in sexual utilitarianism, believe that this has become a minor factor. They hold that modern bower‐birds are intelligent, consciously aesthetic, and that they carry out their complex display activities essentially for relaxation or recreation. This theory is here rejected. Experimental work has shown that gonadectomy inhibits display and bower‐building and that injections of testosterone re‐establishes it. Post‐nuptial (out‐of‐season) display occurs after the seasonal metamorphosis of the testes and the rehabilitation of the interstitium, and is of the same nature as the autumnal display of other birds. Excluding one monospecific genus (Archboldia) of whose bower only fragmentary knowledge is available, true bower‐birds appear to fall into two distinct groups. These are (i) the avenue‐builders (Ptilonorhynchus, Chlamydera, Sericulus) (Fig. i) and (2) the maypole‐builders (Prionodura, Amblyornis) (Fig. 2). The avenue‐builders are widespread throughout both Australia and New Guinea. Each lays down a foundation platform of twigs, and in this wedges twin parallel walls of twigs which sometimes arch overhead. At one, or sometimes both, ends of the bower the male birds arrange their display‐things. One species replaces the terminal display‐grounds with two additional walls which are built at right angles to the original ones. It thus achieves three avenues, in all of which it places decorations. Among avenue‐builders the male builds a bower early in the season, after which it attracts a female to the bower and there displays to it at the focal point of its territory. The male rapidly achieves spermatogenesis but the female cycle lags behind. The male displays (‘dances’) for several months, while the female remains passively in waiting. During this lengthy period of androgen liberation there occurs the remarkable display of bower‐painting, vocal mimicry of other birds, and the insatiable collection of coloured or otherwise distinctive display‐things. In one, and possibly several, species the collected display‐objects are coloured similarly to the watching female. With these in his beak the male displays energetically and often violently but does not approach the female. This has led to published references to ‘sexual fetishism’ in bower‐birds. There is, however, a fundamental difference between the above normal and constant avian activity and a form of psychopathic sexual behaviour in man. Likewise, although the male bower‐birds' prolonged preoccupation with display‐objects while he is in a breeding condition involves a form of sexual sublimation, it is important to remember that this too is normal and constant and a means towards, rather than a sublimation of, reproductive efficiency. The display with the ornaments before the watching female continues unabated until the forest becomes seasonally full of the special protein food on which the young are fed. Then only is the male's physical attention transferred from his display‐things to the waiting female. The female now leaves the bower, alone to build the nest and to rear the young. The male continues his display. His testes, unlike those of most birds, do not metamorphose after the young appear. Thus he remains potentially polygamous, although polygamy has not been proved. In ascribing an essentially utilitarian function to the bower and associated activities, it is not suggested that bower‐birds do not enjoy their extraordinary performances. Further, it is emphasized that bower‐birds appear to have developed their display beyond the bounds of strict utilitarianism, since some individuals successfully reproduce without painting their bowers, and it has been experimentally shown that reproduction (in the aviary without competition) can take place in the absence of coloured decorations. The maypole‐builders, with one exception, are confined to the dense rain‐forests of New Guinea. The fundamental maypole structures are a central growing sapling with a cone of fabric packed around its base. One species, measuring only 9I inches long, extends this cone to a height of about nine feet. Another species surmounts a dwarf cone with a conical, waterproof hut. A third builds over the cone a hemispherical hut fronted by a stockade, and a fourth surmounts the basal cone with a cylinder of moss and fibre which extends up the basic sapling. Fruits, flowers, beetles' wing‐cases and other coloured objects are used to decorate various parts of the structures or their surroundings. Bower‐building of both avenue and maypole types probably originated as a form of displacement activity. The males as well as the females of most passerine birds possess an inherent urge to build nests. To‐day only female bower‐birds seem to build nests. These are built of twigs. The males, on the other hand, have taken to building twig bowers on the display‐ground. Here they spend much of their time during the sexual season. The display‐ground is the focal point of their activity, and, together with the female, of their interest. Nest‐building among females is essentially controlled by the seasonal liberation of hormones. The same appears to be true of male bower‐building. In short, nest‐building is of a bisexual nature, and this has made possible bower‐construction as a displaced building drive, the new product of which has become valuable, ritualized and permanent in the course of the evolution of each species. Bower‐painting is a displaced form of the courtship feeding that is widespread among passerine and other birds. Instead of projecting this attention on the watching female the male does so on his bower which, along with its decorations, is his chief physical preoccupation (apart from feeding and threat) during the weeks or months of spermatogenesis. Of the three cat‐birds, two greenish species indulge in arboreal displays in much the same manner as other passerine birds, whilst the third, the brown stagemaker of tropical Queensland, has taken partly to the rain‐forest floor. Here it clears a space on the ground and covers this with fresh leaves which it cuts each morning by means of a ‘toothed’ beak. The leaves are placed with paler under‐surfaces uppermost, thus creating the more striking effect against the dark earth. From a singing‐stick above the decorated stage the bird calls loudly and continuously and thus advertises its presence and its decorated stage to every potential mate or rival within many hundreds of yards. The precise function of the stage is unknown, but the scanty available data suggest that it, and the vocal display from above, are means toward the cementing of the pair‐bond and effecting the synchronization of the joint sexual processes of the pair. Finally, perhaps, it is the mating place when the monsoon begins and brings with it the seasonal harvest of insect food on which the young will be fed. It has been suggested by cabinet‐workers that ‘bower‐building has been developed coincidentally or perhaps independently’ (Iredale, 1950) and ‘seems to be imitative’ and not indicative of close relationship (Mathews, 1926). This view is rejected. It is believed that the study of bower‐birds as living animals shows that they fall into two distinct families, each of whose members are much closer allied than has been thought. The cat‐birds probably form a family by themselves. Cnemophilus, first considered to be a bird‐of‐paradise, and next a bower‐bird, should be reinstated to its original classification.
